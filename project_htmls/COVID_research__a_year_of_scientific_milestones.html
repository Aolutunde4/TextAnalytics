Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, and his colleagues (G. E. Mena <i>et al</i>. <i>Science</i> <a href="https://doi.org/f9b4" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/f9b4" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/f9b4</a>; 2021). The team found several explanations for this disparity. Compared with higher-income areas, lower-income neighborhoods had high rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. This suggests that testing there was inadequate — and therefore that efforts based on case numbers to curb the epidemic couldn’t be appropriately targeted.</p><p>Low-income areas had one-quarter as many hospital beds per 10,000 people as did wealthy areas. And a striking 90% of COVID-19 deaths in lower-income areas occurred outside of health-care facilities, compared with 55% in a more affluent area of the capital.</p><p>Finally, by using location data from mobile phones, the team found that people in low-income areas moved more during periods when residents were supposed to stay at home — possibly because more people had jobs outside of the house.</p><figure class="figure">

The study found that, during that time, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate dipped as low as 0.04% in the tested population — down from around 5% in early 2020 at the height of the United Kingdom’s first wave — and then began climbing to a peak of about 0.13% in the final round of testing.</p><p>Prevalence rates early in the second wave were highest among young adults aged 18–24, at 0.25%, compared with 0.04% among those aged 65 and older. This suggests that increased socializing by younger people probably drove the resurgence. These age patterns were not reflected in data from routine surveillance at health-service providers, which underestimated infection rates in younger age groups.</p><p>The researchers say that their study demonstrates the benefit of large-scale community testing in providing an early warning of spikes in infections, even at low levels of transmission.</p><figure class="figure">

The insight — if confirmed in humans — could speed the development of next-generation vaccines.</p><p>Vaccines can trigger diverse immune responses, including the manufacture of antibody molecules that bind and block infectious viruses, and the activation of T cells that kill virus-infected cells. By identifying the immune responses that can predict a vaccine’s success, scientists could more easily judge candidate vaccines.</p><p>To identify which immune responses are important for Moderna’s vaccine, Barney Graham and Robert Seder at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, and their colleagues gave monkeys a range of vaccine doses and exposed the animals to SARS-CoV-2 (K. S. Corbett <i>et al</i>. Preprint at bioRxiv <a href="https://doi.org/f8pf" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/f8pf" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/f8pf</a>; 2021). The vaccinated animals that had the lowest levels of viral genetic material in their noses and lungs also had the highest levels of antibodies that recognize the viral spike protein, the molecule that the Moderna vaccine encodes. Levels of other immune markers did not correlate as strongly with the vaccine’s protective effects. The findings have not yet been peer reviewed.</p><p>A parallel study now under way will compare immune markers in people who were protected by jabs, including the Moderna one, with markers in people who were infected despite receiving a vaccine. Identifying these ‘correlates of protection’ will help researchers to assess existing and future vaccines without running costly, large-scale clinical trials.</p><figure class="figure">

But some people have rare antibodies against other coronaviruses that pre-date the pandemic and can bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins other than spike. To search for a possible link between such antibodies and protection from COVID-19, Scott Hensley at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and his colleagues studied antibody levels and infection status in about 2,000 local volunteers during two COVID-19 surges (S.

But high concentrations of other antibodies that had been elicited by two betacoronaviruses — a category that includes SARS-CoV-2 — were associated with a quicker recovery from COVID-19 symptoms.</p><p>The authors speculate that this protection is provided by immune-system players called T cells that were generated in response to previous betacoronavirus infection.

The variants, B.1.427 and B.1.429, have been identified in 30 countries and most US states and, by February 2021, accounted for more than half of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses sequenced from California.</p><p>To better gauge any threat posed by the variants, David Veesler at the University of Washington in Seattle and his colleagues conducted laboratory tests of the variants’ ability to elude infection-blocking molecules called neutralizing antibodies (M. McCallum <i>et al</i>. Preprint at bioRxiv <a href="https://doi.org/f5jq" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/f5jq" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/f5jq</a>; 2021). The tests showed that neutralizing antibodies generated by people who had received two doses of either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine were, on average, three times less potent against viruses with the spike-protein mutations found in B.1.427 and B.1.429 than against viruses lacking those mutations.

While analysing UK SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data, Ben Jackson at the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues detected several lineages that arose through recombination, which is common in coronaviruses (B. Jackson <i>et al</i>.

The team found evidence that four of the eight lineages identified had spread between individuals.</p><p>Six of the recombinant lineages contain the version of the spike gene — which encodes the protein that the virus uses to enter host cells — carried by the B.1.1.7 variant. This version of spike harbours mutations that might underlie the variant’s enhanced transmission. However, the researchers stress that there is no evidence that recombination has led to lineages that are altered in important ways, and the discovery of recombinant lineages does not have immediate implications for the course of the pandemic.

Alessandro Sette and Alba Grifoni at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and their colleagues looked at whether these variants’ mutations might also help them to evade T cells — a component of the immune system that is particularly important for reducing the severity of infectious diseases (A.

The researchers then tested the cells’ ability to recognize protein snippets from four emerging variants, including the B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa.</p><p>Most of the volunteers’ T cells recognized all four variants, thanks to viral protein snippets that were unaffected by the variants’ mutations.

</figure><p><b>4 March — A new viral variant hits a COVID-ravaged city</b></p><p>A coronavirus variant detected in the Brazilian city of Manaus might be driving reinfections and the city’s second wave of COVID-19.</p><p>During the first wave of the pandemic, Manaus experienced one of the world’s highest infection rates: an estimated two-thirds of residents were infected by October 2020, leading some researchers to predict that population-wide immunity might cause new infections to tail off. But in January 2021, researchers identified a novel coronavirus variant, called P.1, during a period of rising hospitalizations in the city and linked the variant to a few cases of reinfection.</p><p>To characterize the variant further, Nuno Faria, at Imperial College London, and his colleagues analysed viral genomes collected from 184 human samples in Manaus between November and December (N. R. Faria <i>et al</i>. Preprint at <a href="https://github.com/CADDE-CENTRE/Novel-SARS-CoV-2-P1-Lineage-in-Brazil/blob/main/manuscript/FINAL_P1_MANUSCRIPT_25-02-2021_combined.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://github.com/CADDE-CENTRE/Novel-SARS-CoV-2-P1-Lineage-in-Brazil/blob/main/manuscript/FINAL_P1_MANUSCRIPT_25-02-2021_combined.pdf" data-track-category="body text link">https://go.nature.com/3sor3jj</a>; 2021). The variant harbours 17 mutations that alter SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Among the alterations are changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that have been previously linked to increased transmission and immune evasion.</p><p>By modelling the spread of P.1 and its possible effects during Manaus’ second wave, the researchers estimated that the variant was 1.4–2.2 times more transmissible than other lineages and that it was able to evade some of the immunity conferred by previous infections. The findings have not yet been peer reviewed.</p><figure class="figure">

By contrast, unvaccinated participants had an infection rate of 0.8%.</p><p>The team also noted that participants who showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection well after vaccination tended to have lower levels of the coronavirus in their bodies than did those who were infected and unvaccinated, although the result did not reach statistical significance. If corroborated, this would suggest that the few vaccinated health-care workers who do have an asymptomatic infection are less likely to infect other people than are unvaccinated workers who become infected.</p><p>The findings have not yet been peer reviewed.</p><figure class="figure">

Susan Hopkins at Public Health England in London and her colleagues tracked the effectiveness of the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech in 23,000 UK health-care workers who were already part of a long-term study of SARS-CoV-2 immunity (V.

Most of this work stems from experiments not on SARS-CoV-2, but on viruses such as HIV that have been modified to contain SARS-CoV-2’s signature spike protein.</p><p>Pei-Yong Shi at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and his colleagues engineered several variants of SARS-CoV-2, including one containing the same spike-protein mutations as a troubling variant called B.1.351 (also known as 501Y.V2) that was first identified in South Africa (Y.

Antibodies elicited by the vaccine neutralized the virus only one-third as effectively as they did a strain lacking those mutations.</p><p>The researchers traced most of the virus’s evasive ability to a trio of mutations in the portion of the spike protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to adhere to host cells. However, it is not clear whether these changes make the vaccine less effective at preventing COVID-19.</p><figure class="figure">

To test the efficacy of this strategy, Andrew Pollard at the University of Oxford and his colleagues examined clinical-trial data from more than 17,000 people, half of whom received the vaccine and the other half a placebo (M.

Yonatan Grad at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, and his colleagues examined the results of daily SARS-CoV-2 tests on 65 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, including 7 infected with B.1.1.7 (S. M. Kissler <i>et al</i>.

The team looked at how long the virus persisted, and the amount of virus present at each time point.</p><p>In people infected with B.1.1.7, infections lasted an average of 13.3 days, compared with 8.2 days in people with other variants. There was little difference in the peak concentrations of the virus between the two groups.</p><p>These findings hint that B.1.1.7 is more easily transmitted than other variants are because people who catch it are infected for a relatively long time, and can therefore infect a larger number of contacts. This suggests that longer quarantine periods might be warranted for individuals infected with this variant. The findings have not yet been peer reviewed.</p><figure class="figure">

Andrew McGuire at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, and his colleagues collected blood from ten people who had recovered from COVID-19; they collected additional samples after the study participants had received a single dose of one of the two vaccines (L.

The researchers then examined the participants’ levels of neutralizing antibodies — which defend cells from infection — against the original version of SAR-CoV-2, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, and against B.1.351, the concerning new variant that was first identified in South Africa.</p><p>Before inoculation, nine of the ten individuals had neutralizing antibodies against the original virus, although the levels generated were highly variable. Antibodies from only five people could neutralize B.1.351. Following a single shot of the vaccine, however, participants’ levels of neutralizing antibodies against both forms of the virus increased by approximately 1,000-fold.</p><figure class="figure">

Kevin McCarthy and Paul Duprex at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania and their colleagues searched a database of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and identified more than 1,000 viruses with deletions in the genomic region that encodes a protein called spike (K. R.

The virus uses the spike protein to invade cells.</p><p>Further analysis showed that the deletions tended to crop up at a few distinct sites in the genomic region coding for spike. Some of the deletions have arisen independently multiple times, and some show evidence of spread from one person to another.</p><p>A powerful antibody against SARS-CoV-2 could not latch onto spike proteins harbouring some of the deletions that the team identified. But antibody mixtures collected from people who had recovered from COVID-19 could disable viral variants that had deletions.</p><figure class="figure">

He had been diagnosed with cancer in 2012; the illness and his treatment had probably weakened his immune system.

</figure><p><b>4 February — </b><b>What makes a person with COVID more contagious? Hint: not a cough</b></p><p>The amount of SARS-CoV-2 in a person’s body is a major factor in determining whether they are likely to transmit the virus to others, according to a study of nearly 300 infected people and their close contacts.</p><p>Most people with COVID-19 do not give it to anyone else, but some become ‘superspreaders’. To understand why, Michael Marks at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and his colleagues monitored 282 people, deemed ‘index cases’, who had recently developed mild symptoms of COVID-19. The team also monitored 753 people who lived with, cared for or otherwise had close contact with the index cases (M. Marks <i>et al.</i> <i>Lancet Infect. Dis</i>. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30985-3/fulltext" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30985-3/fulltext" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30985-3</a>; 2021).</p><p>Only one-third of the index cases transmitted the virus to a close contact. Those with a relatively high ‘viral load’, a measure of the amount of virus in the body, were much more likely to pass on the virus than were those with a low viral load. Index cases were no more likely to transmit the virus if they had a cough than if they didn’t.</p><p>The findings suggest that tracing the contacts of people with high viral loads is especially important, the authors say.</p><figure class="figure">

The team also studied 4,900 participants who received two doses of a placebo (D. Y. Logunov <i>et al.

Hanneke Schuitemaker at Janssen Vaccines and Prevention in Leiden, the Netherlands, and her colleagues tested the vaccine’s safety and immune-stimulating properties in more than 800 people aged 18 years and up (J.

</figure><p><b>12 January — Immune cells gone wild are tied to COVID lung damage</b> </p><p>Some of the severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 seem to result from the activity of specific immune cells, which can cause long-term inflammation of the lungs.</p><p> Alexander Misharin at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and his colleagues examined fluid from the lungs of 88 people with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (R. A.

Most of these individuals had high numbers of a certain type of T cell, a class of immune cells, in their lungs. The researchers also found that nearly 70% of alveolar macrophages, a type of immune cell that is located in the tiny air sacs of the lungs, contained SARS-CoV-2. The cells harbouring the virus showed relatively high expression of genes involved in inflammation. </p><p>The findings suggest that, once the virus reaches the lungs, it can infect macrophages, which respond by producing inflammatory molecules that attract T cells. T cells, in turn, produce a protein that stimulates macrophages to make more inflammatory molecules. This persistent lung inflammation could lead to some of the life-threatening consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p><b>11 January — Traitorous antibodies are linked to COVID death</b></p><p>Antibodies normally attack pathogens, but, sometimes, rogue antibodies instead besiege bodily components such as immune cells. Now, a new study adds to the growing body of research tying these ‘autoantibodies’ to poor outcomes in people with COVID-19.</p><p>Ana Rodriguez and David Lee at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City and their colleagues studied autoantibody levels in blood serum collected from 86 people who required hospitalization for COVID-19. The researchers were particularly interested in autoantibodies against the protein annexin A2, which helps to stabilize cell-membrane structure. It also plays a part in ensuring the integrity of tiny blood vessels in the lungs. Blocking annexin A2 leads to lung injury, a hallmark of COVID-19.

Shortly thereafter, Lindsey Baden at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, Hana El Sahly at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and their colleagues published the results of a vaccine trial that enrolled more than 30,000 volunteers.

But adding stay-at-home orders to those actions brought only marginal benefit.</p><p>Questions linger about the relative effectiveness of specific measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To pinpoint the most useful, Jan Brauner at the University of Oxford, UK, and his colleagues modelled the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in 41 countries between 22 January and either 30 May or the first easing of restrictions (J. M. Brauner <i>et al</i>. <i>Science</i> <a href="https://doi.org/ghp2p7" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/ghp2p7" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/ghp2p7</a>; 2020). The team also examined when each country implemented seven common anti-transmission measures.</p><p>By combining the two data sets, the researchers found that closing schools and universities had a “large effect” in dampening viral spread. Most countries closed schools and universities in quick succession, making it impossible for the team to disentangle the effects of each type of closure.</p><p>In countries that closed schools and businesses and restricted gatherings, a stay-at-home order did little more to reduce transmission, the authors found.</p><figure class="figure">

Some of the autoantibodies attacked the body’s immune cells, hampering the ability to fight off infection. Others attacked the central nervous system, the heart, the liver or connective tissue.</p><p>No single autoantibody was common enough to be used to distinguish people with COVID-19 from uninfected people. The authors say the diversity of autoantibodies could explain the various disease states that follow COVID-19.</p><figure class="figure">

Jesse Bloom at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, and his colleagues mapped every possible SARS-CoV-2 mutation that could prevent binding by three monoclonal antibodies: one manufactured by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the two in a ‘cocktail’ made by Regeneron in Tarrytown, New York (T.

The researchers found one mutation that caused the virus to escape recognition by Regeneron’s antibody cocktail, and a few others that helped it to escape one of the three antibodies.</p><p>Few of these mutations are circulating widely in infected people. But one is prevalent in Europe, and another has been detected in the Netherlands and Denmark, where it has been found in SARS-CoV-2 samples taken from mink and people working at mink farms. The findings have not yet been peer reviewed.</p><p><b>2 December ― Why a sensitive COVID test can yield false negatives</b></p><p>The gold-standard method for diagnosing COVID-19 is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which detects the coronavirus’s genetic material in a nose or throat swab. Now, a survey of more than 15,000 people has singled out the people most likely to receive false negatives on the test.</p><p>Caitlin Dugdale at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and her colleagues looked at PCR test results from about 15,000 people who showed COVID-19 symptoms or were thought for other reasons to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (C. M. Dugdale <i>et al</i>. <i>Open Forum Infect.

Nearly 2,700 individuals tested negative and had a second PCR test done within 2 weeks.</p><p>Among those who received a second test, 60 — or 2.2% — tested positive. Of these, 60% had their initial test either one day or less before symptom onset or more than 7 days after it, suggesting that the PCR test is most likely to yield a false negative in people tested early or late in the course of infection.</p><p>People with COVID-19 symptoms who test negative should be retested, especially in areas where the virus is widespread, the researchers say.</p><figure class="figure">

The transmission risk was lower still for social contacts and community encounters, such as those on public transport. Every extra day of contact raised transmission risk by 10%, the team found.</p><p>The analysis suggests that Hunan’s lockdown actually increased the risk of viral spread within households, whose members spent more time than normal at home together during lockdown.

Sophie Uyoga at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kifili, Kenya, and her colleagues searched for such antibodies in samples of blood donated in Kenya between late April and mid-June (S. Uyoga <i>et al</i>. <i>Science</i> <a href="https://doi.org/fhsx" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/fhsx" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/fhsx</a>; 2020). Based on those samples, the researchers estimate that 4.3% of Kenya’s people had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>The team’s estimate of antibody prevalence in Kenya is similar to an earlier estimate for the level in Spain. But Spain had lost more than 28,000 people to COVID-19 by early July, whereas Kenya had lost 341 by the end of the same month. The authors write that the “sharp contrast” between Kenya’s antibody prevalence and its COVID-19 deaths hints that the coronavirus’s effects are dampened in Africa.</p><figure class="figure">

</figure><p><b>11 November — A coronavirus mutation could weaken antibodies’ power</b></p><p>A widespread variant of the new coronavirus has the potential to evade the immune response that some people mount after infection.</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, researchers have identified thousands of viral mutations in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples taken from infected people. David Robertson at the University of Glasgow, UK, Gyorgy Snell at Vir Biotechnology in San Francisco, California, and their colleagues examined a mutation called N439K in a protein that the virus uses to invade cells (E. C. Thomson <i>et al</i>. Preprint at bioRxiv <a href="https://doi.org/fhnp" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/fhnp" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/fhnp</a>; 2020).</p><p>

 </div></p><p>The mutation affects the protein’s receptor binding domain, which it uses to recognize host cells, and which is a key target of antibodies against the virus. The mutation has emerged independently at least twice and has been identified in 12 countries.</p><p>In laboratory experiments, the researchers found that the mutation could hinder the activity of potent neutralizing antibodies that block the virus. Among the neutralizing antibodies that the mutation obstructed were those in the blood of people who had recovered from COVID-19, as well as some manufactured ‘monoclonal antibodies’ that are being developed into treatments. The findings have not yet been peer reviewed.</p><p><b>9 November — Uninfected children have antibodies to the coronavirus</b></p><p>Scientists have found antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of people who have never caught the virus. Children are particularly likely to harbour such antibodies, which might explain why most infected children have either mild illness or none at all.</p><p>It has been unclear whether previous infection with one of the ‘seasonal’ coronaviruses — which cause the common cold — wards off SARS-CoV-2 or its severe symptoms. George Kassiotis at the Francis Crick Institute in London and his colleagues analysed blood samples from both adults and children who had not been infected with the new virus (K. W. Ng <i>et al</i>. <i>Science</i> <a href="https://doi.org/fg9k" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/fg9k" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/fg9k</a>; 2020). The samples were collected either before the pandemic began or just as the virus began its global march.</p><p>The team found that roughly 5% of 302 uninfected adult participants had antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2. So did more than 60% of uninfected participants aged 6 to 16 — the age group in which antibodies to seasonal coronaviruses are most common. Most blood samples from uninfected people who had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 blocked the new coronavirus from infecting cells in lab dishes.</p><figure class="figure">

The researchers fused 60 copies of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein — the part of the virus that allows it to infect human cells — to the outside of each of these ‘nanoparticles’.</p><p>When the team injected mice with the nanoparticle vaccine, the animals produced virus-blocking antibodies at levels comparable to or greater than those produced by people who had recovered from COVID-19. Mice that received the vaccine produced about ten times more of these antibodies than did rodents vaccinated only with the spike protein, on which many COVID-19 vaccine candidates rely.</p><p>The vaccine also appears to produce a strong response from special immune cells that help to mount a fast defence after infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p><figure class="figure">

Before and after play restarted, athletes and staff members were repeatedly checked for SARS-CoV-2 with a version of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction method, which can be used to assess a person’s viral levels.

But in a randomized, controlled trial of 243 people with moderate disease, the team found no statistically significant reduction in deaths or the need for ventilation among those who received tocilizumab compared with those who didn’t. The study does not rule out the possibility that a larger trial with more statistical power could uncover a benefit.</p><figure class="figure">

James Hay at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, and his colleagues, used modelling to show that the viral loads of a population correlate with the rate of viral spread in that population (J.

Later in the epidemic, the average infected person has had the virus for longer and has a low viral load.</p><p>As a result, a snapshot of the viral-load distribution in a random sample of a population can reveal whether cases in that population are on the rise or are declining, the researchers say. They add that their method is less susceptible to biases from changing COVID-testing practices than simply counting daily cases.

But not all of the tests on the market are equally effective at detecting the virus.</p><p>Antigen-based assays detect specific surface proteins, or antigens, on SARS-CoV-2 particles, and are easy to use and inexpensive to produce. Marion Koopmans at the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and her colleagues used 5 commercially available rapid antigen assays on samples from 1,754 people who had already tested positive for the coronavirus with the standard polymerase chain reaction test, which is highly sensitive but slow (J. van Beek <i>et al</i>.

Research has given a mixed picture of whether the new coronavirus shows similar behaviour.</p><p>To see how the changing seasons affected the virus’s spread in China, Canelle Poirier and Mauricio Santillana at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and their colleagues created a model incorporating data from China collected between mid-January and mid-February (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74089-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74089-7" data-track-category="body text link">C.

In crowded cities, however, people are more likely to have to cope with outbreaks that last longer than do those in the countryside.</p><p>The researchers applied their model to 310 cities worldwide, and predict that those with relatively even population distributions, such as Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia, could expect a short-term explosion in cases.

Jean-Laurent Casanova at the Rockefeller University in New York City and his colleagues analysed DNA from people with severe COVID-19, looking for specific mutations in genes that trigger production of type-I interferons (Q.

The team found that 3.5% of study participants had such mutations, which rendered them unable to manufacture the signalling chemicals.</p><p>In a second study, of severely ill people, Casanova, Paul Bastard at the University of Paris and their colleagues looked for autoantibodies — antibodies that, for unknown reasons, attack the body’s own tissues and organs (P.

Laboratory experiments confirmed that the auto-antibodies knocked out type-I interferon activity.</p><p>The researchers suggest that interferons could be used as therapies for the disease.</p><figure class="figure">

This could help to explain why the disease strikes older people particularly hard.</p><p>The immune system’s ‘adaptive’ branch, which targets specific invaders, has three principle components: antibodies, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Alessandro Sette and Shane Crotty at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California studied the adaptive immune response in 24 people whose COVID-19 symptoms ranged from mild to fatal (C. R.

The passengers had travelled in Canada and the United States before the flight and tested positive for the new coronavirus soon after arriving in Hong Kong. The flight attendants tested positive shortly thereafter.</p><p>The team found that the viral genomes of all four were identical and that their virus was a close genetic relative of some North American SARS-CoV-2 samples — but not of the SARS-CoV-2 prevalent in Hong Kong. This suggests that one or both of the passengers transmitted the virus to the crew members during the flight, the authors say.

</figure><p><b>8 September — Kids ravaged by COVID-19 show unique immune profile</b></p><p>Most children infected with the new coronavirus show few signs of illness, if any. But a few children are struck by a severe form of COVID-19 that can cause multiple organ failure and even death. Now, scientists have begun to tease out the biology of this rare and devastating condition, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C.</p><p>Doctors have diagnosed hundreds of cases of MIS-C, which shares some similarities with the childhood illness Kawasaki’s disease. To understand MIS-C’s biological profile, Petter Brodin at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and his colleagues looked at 13 children with MIS-C, 28 children with Kawasaki’s disease and 41with mild COVID-19 (C. R. Consiglio <i>et al</i>. <i>Cell</i> <a href="https://doi.org/d8fh" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/d8fh" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/d8fh</a>; 2020). The researchers found that compared with children with Kawasaki’s disease, those with MIS-C have lower levels of an immune chemical called IL-17A, which has been implicated in inflammation and autoimmune disorders.</p><p>Unlike all the other children studied, children with MIS-C had no antibodies to two coronaviruses that cause the common cold. This deficit might be implicated in the origins of their condition, the authors say.</p><figure class="figure">

To examine the effects of steroids in general, Jonathan Sterne at the University of Bristol, UK, and his colleagues did a meta-analysis that pooled data from seven clinical trials; each of the seven studied the use of steroids in people who were critically ill with COVID-19 (REACT Working Group <i>J.

The trials included more than 1,700 people across 12 countries.</p><p>The team analysed participants’ status 28 days after they were randomly assigned to take either a steroid or a placebo. The risk of death was 32% for those who took a steroid and 40% for those who took a placebo. The authors say that steroids should be part of the standard treatment for people with severe COVID-19.</p><figure class="figure">

The team tested 97 farmworkers and their contacts, and found evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection in 66 of them.</p><p> Genetic analysis suggested that workers had introduced SARS-CoV-2 to mink, which spread the virus back to workers, who might then have passed it on to other people.

Daniela Weiskopf and Alessandro Sette at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California analysed such T cells, and found that they recognize particular sequences of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins (J.

The findings add weight to the hypothesis that existing immunity to cold coronaviruses could contribute to differences in COVID-19 severity, but further studies are required to support that conclusion.</p><p><b>5 August — Antibody blend protects monkeys and hamsters from viral symptoms</b></p><p>A mixture of two human antibodies against the new coronavirus shows promise in animal tests for preventing and treating COVID-19.</p><p>Neutralizing antibodies are immune molecules that can attach to viruses and disable them.

A follow-up analysis found that people with blood type A+ had an increased risk of lung failure compared with those with other blood types, whereas those with type O blood were protected to some extent. The study flagged a second variant, on chromosome 3, that is near six genes, including one that interacts with the molecular receptor the virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The study has not yet been peer reviewed.</p><p><b>3 June — Drug hailed for its potency fails to prevent infection </b></p><p>A large clinical trial has found no evidence that the drug hydroxychloroquine protects people from COVID-19.</p><p>Some world leaders have embraced hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 or as an agent to prevent the disease. David Boulware at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and his colleagues randomly assigned 821 people to take either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo within 4 days of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (D.

 </div></p><p>Richard Boucher and Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and their colleagues tracked the ease with which the new coronavirus infects various cell types in the respiratory tract. The researchers found a gradient of infectivity that decreases from the upper to the lower respiratory tract: the most easily infected cells are in the nasal cavity, and the least easily infected deep in the lungs. (Y. J. Hou <i>et al</i>. <i>Cell</i> <a href="http://doi.org/dw2j" data-track="click" data-label="http://doi.org/dw2j" data-track-category="body text link">http://doi.org/dw2j</a>; 2020).

The team’s structural analysis shows that S309 binds to a location on spike that is distinct from the attachment site of some of the person’s other coronavirus-targeted antibodies. Two cocktails, each combining one of these two antibodies with S309, were better at blocking the virus than was each antibody alone.</p><figure class="figure">

No viral RNA was detected in staff rooms after they had been disinfected. Low to undetectable levels were found in the hospitals’ well-ventilated patient wards.</p><p>The presence of airborne viral RNA suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to spread by way of aerosols, the researchers say.

But Hong Kong relied on a programme that included widespread testing, quarantining of those who had been in contact with infected people, and distancing measures such as school closures. When Peng Wu at the University of Hong Kong and her colleagues surveyed residents in early March, 99% said they wore a mask in public and 85% said they avoided crowds (B. J.

Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, modelled the spread of coronaviruses in places that have temperate climates, such as the United States. The results helped the team to predict the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (S.M.

That’s because distancing measures leave a high proportion of people susceptible to infection, leading to a spike of disease if viral transmission ramps up late in the year.</p><p>If human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 wanes over the course of a few years, the virus is likely to cause repeated outbreaks in wintertime, the authors say.</p><p><b>15 April — Common sequencing technique could speed large-scale diagnosis </b></p><p>A standard genomic-analysis method that can sequence tens of thousands of DNA samples in a day has been adapted to detect the virus that causes COVID-19.</p><p>In a testing protocol proposed by Jonathan Schmid-Burgk at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his team, every sample being tested for SARS-CoV-2 would be tagged with a unique DNA sequence that would serve as a biological barcode (J.

</figure><p><b>9 April</b> <b>— Absent antibodies suggest mystery immune response</b></p><p>After recovering from infection with SARS-Cov-2, many people have high levels of antibodies against the virus. But a recent study finds that in some recovered patients, such antibodies are present at very low levels — and in some cases are undetectable.</p><p>When a foreign microbe intrudes on the body, the immune system usually makes proteins called antibodies that help to fight off the invader. A team led by Jinghe Huang and Fan Wu at Fudan University in Shanghai, China measured antibodies to the novel coronavirus in 175 volunteers who had recovered from mild infections (F. Wu <i>et al</i>. <a href="http://doi.org/dxb9" data-track="click" data-label="http://doi.org/dxb9" data-track-category="body text link">http://doi.org/dxb9</a>, 2020; not peer reviewed before posting). About 30% of the volunteers — and especially those under the age of 40 — never developed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting that other immune responses helped rid them of their infections.</p><p><b>8 April — Viral load soars as infected people start feeling ill</b></p><p>Viral RNA levels are highest in people with COVID-19 soon after their symptoms appear, according to two separate research teams.</p><p>Kwok-Yung Yuen at The University of Hong Kong–Shenzhen Hospital, China, and his colleagues analysed saliva samples coughed up by 23 people infected with SARS-CoV-2. The team found that study participants’ viral concentrations peaked shortly after they started feeling ill, and began declining about one week after the peak.</p><p>The more viral RNA detected in a person’s body, the more they excrete when coughing or sneezing. The authors say that the high levels of SARS-CoV-2 particles detected at the onset of symptoms suggest that the virus can be transmitted easily between people, even when symptoms are relatively mild (K. K.-W. To <i>et al. Lancet</i> <i>Infect. Dis.</i> <a href="http://doi.org/ggp4qx" data-track="click" data-label="http://doi.org/ggp4qx" data-track-category="body text link">http://doi.org/ggp4qx</a>; 2020).</p><p>The results are consistent with another study of nose and throat swabs from 18 people with COVID-19. The concentrations of viral RNA in the 17 symptomatic patients were similar to that in the one asymptomatic patient (L. Zou <i>et al. N. Engl. J.

This analysis shows that horseshoe bats (<i>Rhinolophus</i> spp.) host an expanding lineage of viruses that, like SARS-CoV-2, can infect humans. The team estimates that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 split 40 to 70 years ago from the closely related bat virus RaTG13. Though the two viruses are highly similar genetically, RaTG13 doesn’t infect humans.</p><p>

Symptoms dwindled in all five; within ten days of receiving the plasma, three recipients no longer needed ventilators.</p><p>Other researchers would like to try such transfusions to treat health workers who have been directly exposed.</p><p><b>27 March — Viral proteins point to potential treatments</b></p><p>A list of the human proteins affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus offers a guide to potential treatments for infected people.</p><p>A team led by Nevan Krogan at the University of California, San Francisco, engineered human cells to produce one of 26 proteins made by the coronavirus (D. E. Gordon <i>et al.</i> Preprint at bioRxiv <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.002386" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.002386" data-track-category="body text link">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.002386</a>; 2020; not peer reviewed before posting). This allowed the researchers to identify human proteins that physically interact with coronavirus proteins.</p><p>Out of 332 interactions between human and viral proteins, the authors identified 67 that existing or candidate drugs could potentially disrupt. The researchers and their collaborators are now testing some of these compounds for antiviral activity — and urge others to do the same.</p>
