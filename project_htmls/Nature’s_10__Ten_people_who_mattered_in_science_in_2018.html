            About the image: This design highlights advances in studies of
            atom-thick materials with unusual properties. The image represents
            two graphene sheets offset by a ‘magic’ angle, an arrangement that
            can behave as a superconductor in certain conditions. Image by JVG.

          Yuan Cao’s teenage years were hardly typical. By age 18, he had
          already graduated from high school, completed an undergraduate degree
          at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, and
          travelled to the United States to begin his PhD. He hasn’t slowed down
          since: this year, aged just 21, Cao had two papers published on
          strange behaviour in atom-thick layers of carbon that have spurred a
          new field of physics. Cao admits that his situation is unusual, but
          says he isn’t special. After all, he did spend a full four years at
          university: “I just skipped some of the boring stuff in middle
          school.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Pablo Jarillo-Herrero’s group at the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (MIT) in Cambridge was already layering and rotating sheets
          of carbon at different angles when Cao joined the lab in 2014. Cao’s
          job was to investigate what happened in two-layer stacks when one
          graphene sheet was twisted only slightly with respect to the other,
          which one theory predicted would radically change the material’s
          behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many physicists were sceptical about the idea. But when Cao set out to
          create the subtly twisted stacks, he spotted something strange.
          Exposed to a small electric field and cooled to 1.7 degrees above
          absolute zero, the graphene — which ordinarily conducts electricity —
          became an insulator (<a

            data-track="click"
            data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26154/"

            >Y. Cao <i>et al. Nature</i> <b>556</b>, 80–84; 2018</a
          >). That by itself was surprising. “We knew already that it would have
          a big impact on the community,” says Cao. But the best was yet to
          come: with a slight tweak to the field, the twisted sheets became a
          superconductor, in which electricity flowed without resistance (<a
            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26160"
            data-track="click"
            data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26160"
            data-track-category="body text link"
            >Y. Cao <i>et al. Nature</i> <b>556</b>, 43–50; 2018</a
          >). Seeing the effect in a second sample convinced the team that it
          was real.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to coax atom-thick carbon into a complex electronic state
          through a simple rotation now has physicists clamouring to engineer
          exciting behaviour in other twisted 2D materials. Some even hope that
          graphene could shed light on how more-complex materials super-conduct
          at much higher temperatures. “There are so many things we can do,”
          says Cory Dean, a physicist at Columbia University in New York City.
          “The opportunities at hand now are almost overwhelming.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitting graphene’s ‘magic angle’ — a rotation between parallel sheets
          of around 1.1° — involved some trial and error, but Cao was soon able
          to do it reliably. His experimental skill was crucial, says
          Jarillo-Herrero. Cao pioneered a method of tearing a single sheet of
          graphene so that he could create a stack composed of two layers with
          identical orientation, from which he could then fine-tune alignment.
          He also tweaked the cryogenic system to reach a temperature that
          allowed superconductivity to emerge more clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cao loves to take things apart and rebuild them. At heart, he is “a
          tinkerer”, his supervisor says. On his own time, this means
          photographing the night sky using homemade cameras and telescopes —
          pieces of which usually lie strewn across Cao’s office. “Every time I
          go in, it’s a huge mess, with computers taken apart and pieces of
          telescope all over his desk,” says Jarillo-Herrero.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his youth and shy manner, colleagues say that Cao’s maturity
          shines through in his persistence. Having missed out by a whisker on a
          place in MIT’s physics graduate programme, for example, Cao found a
          way to pursue the subject by joining Jarillo-Herrero’s team through
          the electrical-engineering department. Cao also shrugged off a
          disappointing start to his PhD, after realizing that seemingly
          exciting data that he had spent six months trying to understand were
          due to a quirk of the experimental set-up. “He wasn’t happy, but he
          just rolled up his sleeves and continued working,” Jarillo-Herrero
          says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cao, now 22, doesn’t yet know where he’d like his career to lead. “On
          magic-angle graphene, we still have a lot of things to do,” he says.
          But universities around the world are already eyeing him for not only
          postdoctorate jobs, but also faculty positions, says physicist
          Changgan Zeng, Cao’s undergraduate supervisor and mentor at the
          University of Science and Technology of China. “Among condensed-matter
          physicists in China, everybody knows his name,” Zeng says. The
          university would gladly have him back, but Zeng expects that Cao will
          stay in the United States for now. “There, it’s easier to see the
          stars.”

          Viviane Slon was sure she had made a mistake three years ago, when DNA
          tests on an ancient bone fragment pointed to a union of two extinct
          human groups. Half of the genome looked like a Neanderthal’s; the
          other half matched sequences from Denisovans — a group once found
          throughout Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I was very much of the mindset that this cannot be,” says Slon, a
          palaeo-geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
          Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Slon told no one for several days,
          and wondered whether she had made some mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she couldn’t find an error, Slon shared the results with her
          colleagues and began to ponder what they might mean. Further tests
          determined that the individual — a young adult female affectionately
          named Denny by colleagues — was the daughter of a female Neanderthal
          and a male Denisovan who lived roughly 90,000 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes point to past interbreeding, but a
          direct product of such an encounter had never been found.

            >reported in August</a
          >, reverberated with other scientists and the public, triggering
          hundreds of news articles and thousands of tweets. “It’s probably the
          most fascinating person who’s ever had their genome sequenced,” one
          geneticist said at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slon’s perspective is unique among her peers, says Israel Hershkovitz,
          a palaeoanthropologist at the University of Tel Aviv, Israel. He
          supervised some of Slon’s graduate-degree research, which spanned
          archaeology, anthropology, pathology and anatomy; she even supported
          herself by working in a cadaver lab. “She was not born in a sterile
          DNA lab,” says Hershkovitz. “When she speaks about the Neanderthal,
          she sees the Neanderthal. She sees its physiology, its anatomy, not
          just its genes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Slon says she is drawn to using genetics and other scientific
          approaches to study prehistory because of the lack of written records.
          “Every-thing you can infer is from what people left behind,” she says.
          “It’s almost like solving a riddle.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of her palaeogenetics research has centred around material from
          Denisova Cave, the vast cavern in southern Siberia that gave its name
          to the Denisovans, a cousin group to Neanderthals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slon’s first project on remains from the cave was to sequence the DNA
          in a tooth from the fourth Denisovan individual found there. She also
          co-led a team that found Denisovan DNA in excavated dirt, an approach
          that could transform palaeogenetics — because it doesn’t rely on
          finding rare hominin bones. Slon’s colleagues had to screen more than
          2,300 unidentified bone fragments to find Denny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slon is still working on material from Denisova Cave, which she got to
          visit for the first time earlier this year. And she will continue to
          work on extracting hominin DNA from sediments. She doesn’t expect to
          happen on another once-in-a-lifetime find like Denny, but she is eager
          to plumb ancient genomes for

          examine the lives of hominins who lived beyond Eurasian sites.
          “There’s a whole world that can still be explored,” she says.

          He Jiankui knew he was crossing a new bioethical boundary, when he
          revealed in November that he had altered the genomes of two infants —
          in a way that would be passed on to future generations. “I understand
          my work will be controversial, but I believe families need this
          technology and I’m willing to take the criticism for them,” he said in
          a video announcing the births of twin girls whose genomes he had
          edited using CRISPR, ostensibly to protect them from HIV infection.

            >stronger than He had expected</a
          >. He was widely criticized for ignoring important ethical
          considerations and exposing the girls to unknown risks for an
          uncertain benefit. The Southern University of Science and Technology
          in Shenzhen, China, where He works, distanced itself. The Chinese
          science ministry forbade him from continuing research. And the health
          ministry launched an investigation. He, who is now not speaking to the
          press, disappeared from the world stage as quickly as he had emerged.
        </p>
        <p>
          He came to gene editing as an outsider. The first publication listed
          on his website, from a decade ago, is related to quantum physics. In
          2010, he had publications on economics, evolution and the nature of
          curious repeated sections of DNA in bacterial genomes. He won some
          acclaim for his work in genome sequencing. A company he founded,
          Direct Genomics in Shenzhen, targeted the clinical-sequencing market
          and pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars in investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          But He wanted to get into gene editing. He visited Feng Zhang, a
          CRISPR pioneer, at his laboratory at MIT, who warned him against
          editing human embryos for reproduction. Mark DeWitt, a geneticist at
          the University of California, Berkeley, says that he advised the same.
          Jennifer Doudna at Berkeley, another CRISPR pioneer, refused He’s
          request for a visit because she thought he wasn’t doing anything
          related to this technology. Now, she wonders whether He was “trying to
          leave a trail” of reputable contacts so he could say that he had broad
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          He will leave a complicated legacy. Scientists worry that the field of
          gene editing might now

          technology could lead to new insights into human development and
          potentially some ways of preventing deadly genetic disorders, few
          would argue that He’s approach has helped. “I think he will be judged
          harshly,” says DeWitt.

          When Jess Wade started writing a Wikipedia page every day, she didn’t
          expect her efforts to earn her global attention. She was simply trying
          to correct the online encyclopaedia’s under-representation of

            >women and people of colour in science</a
          >. But in July, when she tweeted about a trollish comment she’d
          received about the work, it prompted an outpouring of support and a
          big boost for her quest. “That wouldn’t have happened without that one
          mean comment,” she says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wade, a polymer physicist at Imperial College London, has tackled many
          science-outreach projects aimed at fostering diversity. She took up
          her page-a-day habit after learning that 90% of Wikipedia editors are
          men and only about 18% of people profiled on the site are women.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has now created about 400 pages and works with organizations to
          host regular ‘edit-a-thons’ — in which people create and edit
          Wikipedia content with an eye to inclusivity. These have inspired
          similar events around the world, including some focused on other
          professions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visibility and momentum that Wade’s project created is important,
          says Lenna Cumberbatch, who studies diversity at the University of St
          Andrews, UK. Although Wikipedia entries won’t fix science’s
          inclusivity problems, efforts such as Wade’s help to change people’s
          expectations. “She’s redressing an imbalance that’s existed for
          aeons,” says Cumberbatch. “When you’re literally writing history —
          that’s kind of cool.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Wade’s Wikipedia campaign isn’t the only thing that thrust her into
          the spotlight this year. In September, she spoke about her engagement
          work at a conference on gender at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics lab
          near Geneva, Switzerland. On the same day, physicist Alessandro
          Strumia from the University of Pisa in Italy delivered a presentation
          questioning women’s ability in physics and attacking policies that
          encourage diversity. “His presentation was totally inappropriate,”
          Wade says, “telling a room of mainly young woman scientists that
          they’d only ever achieve success in physics due to affirmative
          action”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wade once again used social media to highlight the comments, and they
          were widely condemned. Strumia has been

        </p>
        <p>
          Wade expects to press on with her outreach, including stocking school
          libraries with the book <i>Inferior</i> by Angela Saini, which
          explores the harm caused by gender stereotypes. “I think diverse teams
          do better science,” she says. “Doing all this stuff definitely makes
          sure that the academic community is more robust, resilient and
          creative.”

          In October, Valérie Masson-Delmotte and her colleagues presented the
          world with alarming news about its future. Within as little as a dozen
          years, Earth’s average temperature could reach 1.5 °C above what it
          was in the mid-nineteenth century, triggering a wave of changes that
          would transform ecosystems and kill off most of the world’s coral
          reefs, among many other impacts.

            >special report</a
          >
          from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in which
          Masson-Delmotte played a primary part. A climatologist at the
          Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment in Gif-sur-Yvette,
          France, and co-chair of the IPCC working group that assesses the
          physical science of climate change, Masson-Delmotte helped to gather
          the report’s authors, coordinate their work and, ultimately, get the
          report approved by governments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IPCC normally takes the better part of a decade to produce its
          massive assessments, but the 1.5 °C report came together quickly,
          incorporating research published just weeks before the final draft was
          submitted for government review. “I’m really proud,” Masson-Delmotte
          says. “We had a horribly stringent timeline, but I think we managed to
          build trust and ownership of the report by the authors.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The report makes clear that limiting warming to 1.5 °C would have huge
          benefits compared with allowing temperatures to surge to the 2 °C
          level. But keeping to 1.5 °C would require aggressive action to curb
          greenhouse-gas emissions. And even if nations could somehow achieve
          that, the world would look very different: entire ecosystems could be
          destroyed across more than 6% of the planet’s terrestrial surface, and
          70–90% of coral reefs would probably disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This report will be a hard one to ignore,” says co-author Ove
          Hoegh-Guldberg, who is director of the Global Change Institute at the
          University of Queensland in St Lucia, Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diana Liverman, a geographer at the University of Arizona in Tucson,
          singles out Masson-Delmotte’s work to improve diversity and
          representation in the IPCC. Women made up just 22% of the author team
          on the last assessment, completed in 2014; in this report, they
          comprised an unprecedented 40%. Masson-Delmotte also worked to elevate
          the role of early-career scientists and researchers from the global
          south. And for the next full climate assessment, due out in 2021, she
          has introduced procedures to promote engagement by all authors —
          including an online participation tool for scientists who are
          uncomfortable speaking up during meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an attempt to break down scientific silos, researchers from various
          disciplines worked together on every chapter. The result,
          Masson-Delmotte says, was an analysis that focused less on emissions
          scenarios and more on social, technological and governmental policies
          that could foster change — without exacerbating poverty and inequality
          around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Masson-Delmotte spent ten days talking about the report and the wider
          IPCC process with delegates at the United Nations climate summit in
          late 2018. Now, she and the other co-chairs are pushing forward with
          two more reports — one on terrestrial biomes, the other on oceans and
          polar regions, slated for release in August and September 2019,
          respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to the IPCC itself — participation in which is a voluntary
          affair — Masson-Delmotte says that she is stretched to the limit. Her
          own research has been relegated to occasional nights, weekends and
          train rides, and she doesn’t see as much of her two daughters and
          husband as she used to. “It’s frustrating,” she says. “But at the same
          time, it’s awfully stimulating.”

          For many astronomers, Christmas this year came on 25 April at
          precisely 10:00 Coordinated Universal Time. That was when scientists
          with the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission published its first
          major data set: a 551-gigabyte catalogue
          <a

            >detailing the positions and movements of more than 1.3 billion
            stars</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers around the world were eager to dive into the data. But
          Anthony Brown, an astronomer at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands,
          had a different feeling when the catalogue finally rolled out:
          “Tired,” he says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brown had good reason. He leads the Gaia project’s Data Processing and
          Analysis Consortium, a group of more than 400 researchers that had
          been crunching the numbers for years. The Gaia spacecraft, which
          launched in 2013, spins to scan the sky and records the starlight that
          streaks across the camera. Boiling the craft’s data down into precise
          information on stellar positions, motion and other properties requires
          sophisticated processing on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          To researchers who are more interested in using Gaia to explore the
          mysteries of the Milky Way, Brown’s job might seem less than
          glamorous. A calm and measured character, Brown has worked as the
          data-processing consortium’s chair since 2012. His day-to-day job is
          intensively administrative: much of his time involves coordinating
          with and meeting consortium teams to make sure that the mission’s
          data-crunching pipeline, which fans out from an operations centre near
          Madrid, works smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Brown’s care and expertise have been crucial to the success of
          Gaia’s data set, which has already been cited in
          <a
            href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-ref_query?bibcode=2018A%26A...616A...1G&amp;amp;refs=CITATIONS&amp;amp;db_key=AST"

            data-track-category="body text link"
            >more than 700 research papers</a
          >. His efforts have helped to steer the collaboration through myriad
          snags, including a systematic error in the telescope’s parallax data
          -— measures of angles to stars that enable astronomers to work out
          distances. The team decided to characterize the problem carefully and
          explain it in the release, rather than delay for more than a year to
          collect more data to reduce the error, says Amina Helmi, an astronomer
          at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen, the Netherlands,
          and a member of the consortium. Brown has an impressive ability to
          motivate researchers who would rather be working on science, Helmi
          says. “I don’t know how he does it,” she says. “We all respect him.
          There is really this feeling that we all share that wants to make Gaia
          a success.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Brown and his colleagues have had little time to catch their breath.
          They are already preparing the next data release, which will probably
          be ready some time in the first half of 2021. Another is planned after
          that, and more could follow: in November, the mission was extended to
          at least the end of 2020. Brown, who has been involved with Gaia since
          1997, is in no rush to see it end: “Having worked on this mission more
          than 20 years now, it’s definitely part of who I am.”

          Bee Yin Yeo began to question the future of the world — and her own
          career — while evaluating oil wells in the deserts of Turkmenistan.
          The new university graduate decided that humanity would eventually
          move away from fossil fuels, so she decided to find another profession
          that would serve the well-being of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years later, in 2010, she returned home to Malaysia, armed with
          a master’s degree in advanced chemical engineering from the University
          of Cambridge, UK. She joined politics and won a seat in a state
          legislative assembly in 2013. Then, a political tsunami hit Malaysia:
          on 9 May 2018, voters ousted the coalition that had held uninterrupted
          power since the country’s founding in 1963. The new government brought
          in its own cabinet members, including Yeo, who was appointed Minister
          of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeo was “shocked” when she first heard of her appointment. “It was
          unimaginable,” said the 35-year-old, who grew up in a small town amid
          oil-palm and rubber-tree estates in southern Malaysia. Yeo had spent
          the previous 5 years attacking national policies, and now she could
          change them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since taking office on 2 July, Yeo has made several bold steps in
          reforming how Malaysia manages its environment and research. She
          announced goals to increase renewable energy from 2% to 20% of total
          energy generation by 2030, to reform the electricity market and to
          ramp up energy efficiency. She also went to battle against plastics
          pollution — which plagues southeast Asia. She criticized the influx of
          plastic waste into Malaysia, and helped to set a nationwide ban on its
          import. On 31 October, Yeo launched a 12-year roadmap and legal
          framework towards eliminating single-use plastic in Malaysia by 2030,
          which also calls for research and commercialization of eco-friendly
          alternatives, such as biodegradable plastics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeo’s efforts

            >parallel an escalating global concern</a

          over single-use plastics. In October, the European parliament voted to
          ban their use in products such as straws and cutlery. And a growing
          number of other nations have issued similar bans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Julian Hyde, general manager of the environmental organization Reef
          Check Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, praises Yeo’s efforts and roadmap.
          “The most important thing about it is that it’s over a realistic
          timescale.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA) sees
          problems ahead. Ching Yun Wee, who chairs the MPMA’s sustainability
          subcommittee, says that local manufacturers can now produce
          bio-degradable plastics, but that the material cannot yet decompose as
          quickly or completely as is needed to solve the problem of plastic
          pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wee says, however, that compared to her predecessors, Yeo has given
          the MPMA more opportunities to voice its opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeo says that by funding local research and adopting foreign
          techniques, Malaysia can develop the technology for biodegradable
          plastic. “Some people think of problems to solutions, and not
          solutions to the problem,” she says. “When business as usual is not
          possible, you find another solution.”

          In February 2017, Barbara Rae-Venter got a call from an investigator
          looking for help with a criminal case. “I said, ‘Sure,’” says
          Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney in northern California, unaware
          that she was signing up to try and catch one of the most notorious
          serial killers and rapists in US history. This year, Rae-Venter’s work
          not only led to the killer’s arrest, but also demonstrated a powerful
          —

          — approach for identifying criminals through genetic genealogy.
        </p>
        <p>
          “She opened the door for others who wanted to do this, but had
          reservations,” says CeCe Moore, who heads a forensic-genealogy unit at
          the company Parabon Nanolabs in Reston, Virginia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rae-Venter first trained in genetic genealogy — which uses DNA to fill
          out family trees — to explore her own ancestry. Eventually, she
          started using the tools to aid others, such as people who had been
          adopted as children, which drew the attention of Paul Holes, an
          investigator with the Contra Costa county district attorney’s office
          in California.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holes was on the trail of a man who had terrorized California during
          the 1970s and 1980s. With 12 murders, 45 rapes and 120 burglaries
          attributed to him, the elusive perpetrator had become known as the
          East Area Rapist, the Original Night Stalker and the Golden State
          Killer. Holes reasoned that if Rae-Venter could piece together the
          killer’s family history, it could help to find his true name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rae-Venter uploaded a profile made from crime-scene DNA into GEDmatch,
          a public database used by genealogists. Although not nearly as large
          as commercial genealogy websites, GEDmatch’s terms of service didn’t
          expressly prohibit law enforcement from doing searches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right away, she found someone who seemed to be a third or fourth
          cousin to the killer. With the help of the FBI and local law
          officials, she worked to triangulate a common ancestor and then build
          the family tree. She eventually zeroed in on Joseph DeAngelo, a former
          police officer living in Sacramento. A direct test of his DNA proved
          the match.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many in the genealogy community knew that this approach was possible
          and there had been

            >ongoing debates over whether it constituted an invasion of
            privacy</a
          >. Moore says that she had been approached in the past to help in this
          way, but declined because of the debate and because most people who
          used GEDmatch were unaware that it could be done. DeAngelo’s highly
          publicized arrest changed that: the genealogy community, by and large,
          embraced this use of data, at least for finding violent criminals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curtis Rogers, a co-founder of GEDmatch, has amended the database’s
          rules to make it clearer that law enforcement might use the
          information. He hasn’t seen a mass exodus from his site, he says.
        </p>
        <p>
          The floodgates have now opened for these kinds of cases. Under Moore’s
          direction, Parabon Nanolabs has uploaded about 200 perpetrator
          profiles to GEDmatch, resulting in at least 22 identifications and
          nearly as many arrests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rae-Venter says that she has been approached for help in more than 70
          cases. Quiet and private, she is nevertheless excited to get more
          involved. After all, her new calling seems to run in the family. In
          her own research, she identified a great uncle who was a detective
          inspector with the London Metropolitan Police during the time of Jack
          the Ripper. “I would love to find out which cases he worked on,” she
          says.

          says he got his ideas from an unlikely source: the publishers
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March, Robert-Jan Smits was tasked by the European Union’s research
          commissioner, Carlos Moedas, with a special one-year mission: to get
          more research papers published outside journal paywalls, and fast. A
          veteran science-policy bureaucrat, Smits decided to go to the source:
          he asked big publishers how he could do it. They told him that if the
          organizations that pay for research insisted the findings had to be
          published openly, journals would have to adapt.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that’s what Smits set out to persuade research funders to do — in a

            >pulling the science-policy strings at the European Commission</a
          >, and, until his current assignment, had served eight years as the
          director-general of research. He was ideally connected to begin
          rallying Europe’s agencies with the idea, dubbed Plan S for ‘science,
          speed, solution, shock’, as he puts it. As <i>Nature</i> went to
          press, 16 funders had signed the plan; they require that the results
          of work they support be made freely available at the time of
          publication, starting in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Publishers have been dictating how research is published for decades,
          Smits says. “Now it is the funders calling the shots, and we will do
          things differently.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s too early to know what the ultimate impact of Plan S on research
          publishing will be. Its details are open for consultation, and much
          might depend on how many other funders adopt the idea — but it will at
          least improve access to research, says Peter Suber, director of the
          Harvard Open Access Project and the Harvard Office for Scholarly
          Communication in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Smits has been overwhelmed
          with messages of support. But the initiative has also met with
          resistance: several publishers have said it could put them out of
          business, and some researchers have said that they don’t want their
          choice of where to publish to be restricted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smits is no stranger to disrupting the status quo in European science.
          In 2007, he was instrumental in setting up the excellence-focused
          European Research Council (ERC) funding agency — when, he says, very
          few member states wanted it. “We had to go country by country to
          convince people that we needed it,” he says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who have worked with Smits are not surprised by his ability to
          get consensus on controversial policies. “Robert-Jan has a fantastic
          memory, of people, events, documents, policies. His networking
          capacity is spectacular,” says Helga Nowotny, a former president of
          the ERC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smits’ short tenure as open-access tsar is almost over. Next year, he
          will leave to become chair of the Eindhoven University of Technology
          in his native Netherlands. “It’s time for me to leave the commission
          at what I consider my height,” he says.

          — a dumpling-shaped rock called Ryugu. In a delicate manoeuvre after a
          journey of more than three years, the Hayabusa2 spacecraft fired its
          thrusters so that it moved in synchrony with the 1-kilometre-wide
          asteroid as they orbited the Sun together.
        </p>
        <p>
          That task achieved, Yoshikawa and his team at the Japan Aerospace
          Exploration Agency (JAXA) moved on to the exploration phase. By early
          October, the craft had successfully

          onto Ryugu — providing the first close-ups of the asteroid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hayabusa2 faces a bigger test next year, when it will gently touch
          down on Ryugu and collect a sample. Any navigational imprecision could
          send it crashing against a boulder. In an even more daring manoeuvre,
          the craft will then shoot a projectile at the asteroid and analyse the
          material that gets kicked up. The probe is due to come back to Earth
          in 2020, carrying specimens that could shed light on the early stages
          of the Solar System’s evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoshikawa has been through nail-biters before. As a JAXA astronomer,
          he helped to mastermind two of the most spectacular rescue operations
          in the history of uncrewed space exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first mission to collect a sample from an asteroid, the original
          Hayabusa, touched down on asteroid Itokawa in 2005. Soon afterwards,
          mission control lost touch with the craft. The team managed to restore
          communications and

            >piloted Hayabusa back to Earth</a
          >, despite having lost its main engine. The speeding craft burnt up
          during its re-entry, but its sample-return capsule was eventually
          recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in 2010, another JAXA probe, Akatsuki, had an engine malfunction
          as it tried to decelerate to enter into orbit around Venus. Akatsuki
          drifted away and went many times around the Sun until 2015, when it
          passed Venus again and the team

          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some mishaps were inevitable, Yoshikawa says, given that Japan’s space
          programme does not have a long tradition of deep-space exploration.
          “We need experience,” he says. But Hayabusa2 has, so far, provided
          some redress for JAXA’s historic ill-fortune.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stephan Ulamec, a geophysicist at the German Aerospace Center in
          Cologne who had a leading role in developing one of the Hayabusa2
          landers, MASCOT, says that risk-taking and the ability to learn from
          failures set Japanese space endeavours apart from more-cautious — and
          better-funded — agencies in the West. “They have a tendency to do bold
          missions, to take risks NASA would not,” he says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoshikawa has the rare ability to lead a collaboration of many
          different laboratories without having a big ego, and that has been key
          to the success of these missions, says Aurélie Moussi, an
          astrophysicist at the French space agency CNES in Toulouse and a
          co-project manager for MASCOT. “He is the kindest scientist I’ve ever
          worked with,” she says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoshikawa has had an interest in asteroids ever since he was a child
          and read <i>The Little Prince</i> — a 1943 novella that features a boy
          who lives on an asteroid and visits Earth. Asteroids are potential
          menaces that need to be kept track of — but they also hold the secrets
          to the Solar System, and are a possible source of materials to mine
          for future space exploration, Yoshikawa says.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Asteroids are very small objects in the Universe — but very important
          for the future life of humans.”

          <i>Nature</i>’s 10 is the journal’s annual list of ten people who
          mattered in science this year. Their role in science may have had a
          significant impact on the world, or their position in the world may
          have had an important impact on science. In ten short profiles we
