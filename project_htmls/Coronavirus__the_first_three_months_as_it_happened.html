The updated statistics include two people who died at home and a third whose location of death was not specified. Previously, the first COVID-19 death in the county was thought to have occurred on 9 March.</p><p>The revised cause of death shows that the deadly disease had footholds in the United States earlier than previously thought. Similar reports have surfaced elsewhere in recent weeks. In late March, a non-peer-reviewed epidemiology study of the Lombardy region in northern Italy found that the virus might have been circulating there for more than a month before it was detected.</p><p><b>22 April 16:45</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>bst â </b></span><b>Climate scientist and IPCC veteran dies of the coronavirus</b></p><p>John Houghton, a climate scientist and a senior member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), died of COVID-19 on 15 April, aged 88.</p><p>Houghton was the lead editor of the first three IPCC assessment reports â massive, influential studies that summarize the state of scientific knowledge on climate change â and accepted the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the organization, alongside former US vice-president Al Gore. Researchers who knew Houghton commended him for his scientific rigour, his leadership and his ability to connect with policymakers and the public.</p><p>After studying at the University of Oxford, UK, Houghton became a professor there in 1958. He was a pioneer in the use of emerging satellite technologies for understanding the Earth system. As the director-general of the UK Met Office, the nationâs weather agency, from 1983 to 1991, he helped to establish the Hadley Centre for Climate Science and Services in Exeter and advised the UK government on the scientific consensus on climate change. âHe knew they could only really make progress if they had very clear and well-communicated scientific advice,â says Richard Betts, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, who worked on several IPCC reports with Houghton.</p><p>Houghtonâs lifetime of leadership in the climate-change community is a significant legacy, Betts says. âHe wasnât just a scientist. He was someone who cared passionately.â</p><p>A devout Christian, Houghton co-founded and led the John Ray Initiative, a charity in Gloucester, UK, focused on promoting environmental stewardship through both science and Christianity. He convinced a prominent US evangelical lobbyist of the compatibility of climate change and Christian thought in the early 2000s. </p><p>His former students remember him fondly. âJohn was an excellent leader,â says James Drummond, a retired atmospheric scientist who most recently worked at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Houghton supervised Drummond through his undergraduate and graduate studies at Oxford in the 1970s. âIf I do a quarter of what he did, I will be doing very well,â says Drummond.</p><p><b>21 April 20:40</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>bst</b></span> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>â</b></span> <b>1,500 people volunteer for controversial vaccine-study approach</b></p><p>Momentum is building to speed the development of coronavirus vaccines by intentionally infecting healthy, young volunteers with the virus. A grass-roots effort has attracted nearly 1,500 potential volunteers for the controversial approach, known as a human-challenge trial.</p><p>The effort, called <a href="https://1daysooner.org/" data-track="click" data-label="https://1daysooner.org/" data-track-category="body text link">1Day Sooner</a>, is not affiliated with groups or companies developing or funding coronavirus vaccines. But co-founder Josh Morrison hopes to show that there is broad support for human-challenge trials, which have the potential to deliver an effective coronavirus vaccine more quickly than standard trials.</p><p>Typical vaccine trials take a long time because thousands of people receive either a vaccine or a placebo, and researchers track who becomes infected in the course of their daily lives. A challenge study could in theory be much faster: a much smaller group of volunteers would receive a candidate vaccine and then be intentionally infected with the virus, to judge the efficacy of the immunization.</p><p>âWe want to recruit as many people as possible who want to do this, and pre-qualify them as likely to be able to participate in challenge trials should they occur,â says Morrison, who is also the executive director of organ-donation advocacy group Waitlist Zero. âAt the same time, we feel that the public policy decisions around challenge trials will be better informed if they highlight the voice of people interested in participating in such trials.â</p><p>Morrison says that the people who have signed up to be part of a challenge trial tend to be young and live in urban areas, and are highly motivated to do something constructive to address the coronavirus pandemic. âMany note that they recognize the risk but believe the benefits of vaccine acceleration are so tremendous that it is worth it to them,â he says.</p><p>A team led by bioethicist Nir Eyal at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00927-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00927-3" data-track-category="body text link">argued that a human challenge trial could be conducted safely</a> and ethically, in a paper in <i>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</i> last month.</p><p>The approach is also gaining some political support.

</figure><p>Renowned British-born mathematician John Conway died aged 82 on 11 April, reportedly of complications arising from COVID-19.</p><p>Conway attained a legendary status among maths and science enthusiasts, mostly by designing mathematical games and puzzles. But his work transcended the boundary between recreational and âseriousâ maths, turning play into research and vice versa. âHeâs been known to carry on his person a few decks of cards, dice, ropes, pennies, coat hangers, sometimes a Slinky, maybe a miniature bicycle, all props he deploys to extend his winning imagination,â wrote <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/523406a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/523406a" data-track-category="body text link">biographer Siobhan Roberts</a> in 2015.</p><p>His celebrity status was cemented by Martin Gardnerâs popular maths column in the magazine <i>Scientific American</i>, which featured many of Conwayâs contributions, beginning in 1970 with his <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mathematical-games-1970-10/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mathematical-games-1970-10/" data-track-category="body text link">Game of Life</a>, a minimalistic 2D model universe in which âorganismsâ grow and multiply on the basis of simple rules.</p><p>Conway had taught at Princeton University in New Jersey since 1987, and his research spanned several fields of mathematics. In algebra, he studied the âmonster groupâ, an object that has an enormous â but not infinite â number of symmetries. With the late British mathematician Simon Norton, he formulated the âmonstrous moonshineâ conjectures, linking the monster group to an entirely different subject in mathematical analysis.</p><p>Conway is also remembered for his work on the foundations of quantum mechanics. He investigated the idea of an experimenterâs free will and suggested that âif experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particlesâ.</p><figure class="figure">

Some of these models, presented to the government in early February, were released on 7 April by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and the University of Melbourne.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.doherty.edu.au/news-events/news/covid-19-modelling-papers" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.doherty.edu.au/news-events/news/covid-19-modelling-papers" data-track-category="body text link">theoretical models</a>, which have not been peer reviewed and are based on information on outbreaks outside Australia, suggest that without measures to mitigate the virusâs spread, hospitals would have been overwhelmed. This scenario would have seen a peak daily demand for 35,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds by around May, according to government figures. </p><p>The figures suggested that social distancing, isolation and quarantine would reduce that peak daily demand to less than 5,000 beds. Australia currently has some 2,200 ICU beds, but plans to increase that to 7000.</p><p>Australia restricted entry to the country for travellers from mainland China on 1 February. Health officials have conducted more than 304,000 coronavirus tests, and have introduced contact tracing, quarantining and isolation, as well as broader physical-distancing measures, such as closing businesses and restricting gatherings.</p><p>âAustralia has acted sufficiently early based in part on the work that we provided,â said James McCaw, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne who contributed to the models, at an online press conference. </p><p>Australia currently has more than 6,000 confirmed cases, with 50 deaths. The daily count of new confirmed cases has declined to around 100, from a high of more than 500. âIt looks like the curve is flattening, and flattening strongly,â said McCaw. âBut our population is still largely susceptible. And so if we relaxed and went back to normal, we would see a rapid and explosive resurgence in epidemic activity.â</p><p>The authors conclude that social distancing needs to be part of ongoing efforts to isolate infected people and quarantine contacts to ensure that hospitals can cope, although they did not look at the effects of specific measures.</p><p>âWeâre really in a very lucky position where we can think about the next steps and the very challenging questions ahead, but from a position of relative calm as opposed to crisis,â said McCaw.</p><figure class="figure">

But last week, thousands of citizens were out for another cause: science. For three evenings, on 23â25 March, 6,000 Italians appeared on their balconies to take part in a citizen-science experiment that has never attempted before â measuring light pollution with their smartphones. </p><p>The project, called Science on the Balcony and run by the Italian National Research Council, asked participants to turn off all the lights in their homes and launch an app designed for the study. Then they were asked to turn their phone screens towards the main light source that could be seen from their windows â for example, a street light or a sign. Using the phoneâs sensors, the app measured the light sourceâs illuminance, or brightness, in units of lux.</p><p>The study was conceived by Luca Perri, an astrophysicist and science communicator at the Astronomical Observatory of Milan, and Alessandro Farini, a vision scientist at Italyâs National Institute of Optics in Florence. Like many nations, Italy has seen a steady increase in night-time light in recent decades. Such light pollution compromises astronomersâ view of space and presents environmental, economic, safety and public-health problems; it can, for instance, affect the immune system.</p><p>

Singapore, for instance, has been using the tests for more than a month to trace known infections and monitor at-risk populations.</p><p>But thoroughly evaluating the efficacy of the tests and the rate of false positives is essential, says Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana, whose team is developing its own serological test.</p><p>The blood test will need to distinguish between antibodies against the COVID-19 virus and those against other seasonal coronaviruses to which people are commonly exposed, he says. âI would expect the false-positive rate to be very high because of this prior exposure â unless they figured out how to make the serological test very specific,â he says. Garry says that for a validated test, he would expect a false-positive threshold of less than 5% â meaning fewer than 5 out of 100 people without the antibodies test positive â although he could see that being relaxed to 10%. Even with ready access to clinical samples, understanding false-positive levels on this timescale would require a massive effort, says Garry.</p><p>

Over the next 6 weeks, participants will receive their first doses, followed by a second 28 days later.

The analysis â based on data from Shenzhen in China â provides a partial answer to one of the most pressing questions surrounding the outbreak: the role of children.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that kids are much less likely than other age groups to develop severe symptoms when infected by the coronavirus. But it was not clear whether this was because they werenât getting infected or because they were fighting off the infection more effectively.</p><p>âKids are just as likely to get infected and theyâre not getting sick,â says Justin Lessler, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. He co-led the study with three other epidemiologists â Qifang Bi, also at Johns Hopkins, Ting Ma at the Harbin Institute of Technology in Shenzhen and Tiejian Feng at the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention. They posted the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1" data-track-category="body text link">analysis</a> to the medRxiv preprint server on 4 March.</p><p>The study is unique in that it looked at not only people who were infected with the virus, but also large numbers of their close contacts, some of whom were infected and many of whom were not. The researchers followed 391 people who were diagnosed on the basis of their symptoms, and 1,286 of their close contacts to see whether these contacts tested positive for the virus even if they didnât show symptoms. Overall, the team found that children under 10 who had potentially been exposed to the virus were just as likely to become infected as other age groups, with between 7% and 8% of contacts of known cases later testing positive.</p><p>The authors also found that people who lived in the same household as someone infected with the virus were about six times more likely get infected than those who made contact with an infected person in other settings.</p><p>âThis may be the first clear evidence that children are as susceptible as adults to SARS-CoV-2 infection,â says Ben Cowling, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. He wonders whether the fact that outbreaks havenât been observed in schools could be down to the fact that childrenâs symptoms are mild.</p><p>Lessler says itâs still not clear whether children are important in transmitting the virus, as they are for influenza; children routinely develop flu symptoms and are common hubs in chains of transmission. âThatâs one of the current critical remaining questions and weâre trying to figure out how to answer it,â he says. âI have a 7-month-old and a 6-year-old and I canât imagine that, if they have any virus at all, theyâre not getting it on somebody.â</p><p>The study could have important implications for slowing the spread of the virus through measures such as school closures. âOnce we say containment is not an option, we canât ignore the kids,â says Lessler.</p><p>âThis is a key piece of data that may support school closures as an effective intervention,â Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/cmyeaton/status/1235571948999991296?s=20" data-track="click" data-label="https://twitter.com/cmyeaton/status/1235571948999991296?s=20" data-track-category="body text link">tweet</a> on 5 March.</p><p><b>5 March 12:55</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>gmt â</b></span> <b>World Bank pledges US$12 billion for coronavirus response</b></p><p>On 3 March, the World Bank Group pledged up to US$12 billion, including $8 billion in new funding, to support countries dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.

</figure><p><b>2 March 20:45</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>gmt â</b></span> <b>WHO raises alert to âvery highâ</b></p><p>At a press briefing on 29 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it had raised the global alert for COVID-19 to the highest possible level, short of calling it a pandemic. The virus has now spread to some 60 locations outside China, with new cases detected in Ireland, Monaco, Azerbaijan, Qatar and Ecuador.</p><p>The global alert for the spread and impact of the coronavirus outbreak increased from âhighâ to âvery highâ. The alert remains âvery highâ in China.</p><p>The global change was based on an assessment by WHO epidemiologists, which took into account the continued increase in the number of cases and affected locations, and the difficulties that some regions, including Iran and Italy, are facing in containing the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said at the briefing that most cases were linked and could still be traced to known contacts or clusters, with no evidence of the virus spreading freely in communities. âAs long as that is the case, we still have a chance of containing this virus, if robust action is taken to detect cases early, isolate and care for patients and trace contacts,â said Tedros.</p><p>The organization therefore once again resisted declaring the outbreak a pandemic. Mike Ryan, director of the WHOâs emergencies programme, said that such a decision would mean that efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the virus have failed, which has proved to be untrue in China, Singapore and other regions.</p><p>The WHO is still holding out hope that the virus can be contained, but we have probably crossed that threshold, says Adam Kamradt-Scott, a global health-security researcher at the University of Sydney, Australia.</p><p>Some countries have already begun to prepare their pandemic plans, which is an important precautionary measure, says Nigel McMillan, an infectious-disease researcher at Griffith University in Brisbane. Australia, for example, initiated its coronavirus emergency response on 27 February. The WHO is being overly cautious in not declaring a pandemic, says McMillan. </p><p><b>2 March 20:30</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>gmt</b></span> <b>â</b> <b>Transmission details emerge from WHO China analysis</b></p><p>China has mounted âperhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in historyâ against a new infectious disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report released on 28 February, after nine days of meetings and site visits in China from 16 to 24 February. The report analyses data from the outbreak in China, and recommends steps that the country and others should take to curb COVID-19. </p><p>Daily reports of new cases are declining in the country, the WHO confirmed â so much so that authorities are now having problems recruiting participants for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00444-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00444-3" data-track-category="body text link">more than 80 clinical trials</a> there that are testing potential treatments for the coronavirus. Some experimental treatments should be prioritized over others, the health agency recommended.</p><p>The reportâs analysis of data from China finds 99.9% similarity between the 104 strains of the coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, collected from people between December 2019 and mid-February 2020. This means that the virus is not mutating significantly. The median age of people infected is 51 years. And most cases of spread from person to person have been in hospitals, prisons or households, which implies that close contact is often required for the virus to spread between people. Airborne spread is not believed to be a major driver of transmission, the report says. In one preliminary study from the province of Guangdong, people in the same household as someone with COVID-19 had a 3â10% chance of being infected.</p><p>The WHO credits Chinaâs ability to rein in the epidemic to a variety of measures. One is that 1,800 teams of epidemiologists have rapidly tracked tens of thousands of contacts of people infected with the virus in Hubei province, where the outbreak emerged. Up to 5% of these contacts ended up having the disease and were diagnosed quickly. And the report says the lockdown on travel out of Hubei â an unprecedented measure in a province of this size â curbed wider spread of the disease to Chinaâs 1.4 billion citizens.</p><p><b>2 March 17:45</b><span class="u-small-caps"><b> gmt</b></span><b> â Coronavirus fears cancel huge physics meeting</b></p><p>

But the huge bump in numbers isnât a sign that the epidemic is worsening, say others; it is instead the result of authorities changing how cases are confirmed.</p><p>On 12 February, Hubei province reported nearly 15,000 new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, representing a 33% jump in total infections worldwide in a single day. Total infections in China now number around 64,000, with more than 1,300 deaths.</p><p>But most of the Hubei cases â about 13,000 â have been reported as a result of a new policy that means physicians in the province can diagnose suspected cases of COVID-19 on the basis of chest scans, rather than having to wait for genetic tests to confirm the presence of the virus, which can take days.</p><p>The policy was established in response to pleas from doctors who are overwhelmed by patients with respiratory diseases, and donât have time to wait for lab results, says Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who helped design and implement the policy. âThe clinicians in Hubei made a very strong request to modify the criteria because of their heavy workload,â he says. Now they can care for people more quickly and ensure they are properly isolated to protect others, says Wu. âWe need to save lives.â</p><p>The policy makes sense from a medical point of view, says Michael Mina, an infectious-disease immunologist and epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. âTriaging based on symptomatic evaluation and physical exam is the bedrock of hospital-based and clinical triage,â he says.</p><p>The new diagnosis method was listed in updated disease-reporting guidelines issued last week. It applies only to Hubei, where the virus originated in the city of Wuhan. Wu says that other provinces arenât as overwhelmed with cases so will still need to confirm suspected cases with genetic tests or lab cultures of the virus taken from patients.</p><p>The Chinese state media outlet Xinhua urged calm after the spike was reported. âAlthough the figures rose, it does not mean that the epidemic in Wuhan has deepened,â it said.</p><p>On 14 February, Chinese authorities revealed for the first time the number of infections in medical staff. They said 1,716 health workers had contracted the virus, 6 of whom had died.</p><p><b>13 February 12:15</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>gmt</b></span> <b>â</b> <b>Chinese virologists raise concerns about virus name</b></p><p>Some researchers in China are unhappy with the designated name for the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

Classification rules and established naming practice also informed the decision.</p><p>Although the two viruses belong to the same species, SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than SARS-CoV but is less deadly, says Shibo Jiang, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai. SARS-CoV retreated in the summer, but nobody knows what the new virus will do in the coming months, he says. People might think it will behave similarly and stop taking precautions come summer.</p><p>Scientists also worry about the potential social and economic impact for China of revisiting the bad memories associated with SARS. âThat name can cause panic to people, and may cause gross economic loss to the affected countries when the virus is circulating,â says Guo Deyin, a virologist at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.</p><p>

Infections have been detected in 24 countries outside China so far.</p><p>Researchers are using flight data to create models of the virusâs possible spread around the world. One model identified 30 countries at risk of importing SARS-CoV-2, on the basis of the large number of flights from Wuhan, the outbreakâs epicentre, and from other cities in China with lots of travellers from Wuhan. But several of those countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, have reported fewer cases than the model predicts. Indonesia, another country at risk, has yet to report a single case.</p><p>The possibility of unreported cases is particularly concerning in countries with weaker health-care systems, such as those in southeast Asia and Africa, which could quickly be overwhelmed by a local outbreak. No cases have been reported in Africa so far, but some countries there, such as Nigeria, are at particular risk because of strong business ties to China.</p><p><b>12 February 17:45 </b><span class="u-small-caps"><b>gmt</b></span> <b>â </b><b> WHO calls for speedy vaccine, drug and diagnostic development</b></p><p>World Health Organization officials outlined their top research priorities for controlling the outbreak of the coronavirus-associated disease now known as COVID-19.

 </div></p><p>Research should also look to understand the best approach for infection prevention, including assessing whether lockdowns in major Chinese cities have had a positive or negative effect on slowing the spread of virus. Virologist Marie-Paule Kieny, who co-chaired the forum, said that there were four vaccine candidates in development. In around three months, she suggested, one or two of those might be in human trials. Still, it will be more than a year until they might be available for wider use. Officials called for research on how to control and counter misinformation that has spread since the start of the outbreak. Finally, Tedros encouraged research into preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases â which originate in animals â to stem future outbreaks of this type.</p><p>Although researchers are already investigating some of these questions, and many others, WHO officials hope that its research blueprint will help to direct donor funding to the most productive avenues. </p><p><b>11 February 15:25</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>gmt</b></span> <b>â Coronavirus disease officially named</b><b> COVID-19</b></p><p>The World Health Organization has <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227248333871173632" data-track="click" data-label="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227248333871173632" data-track-category="body text link">officially named</a> the disease caused by the coronavirus COVID-19.

If efforts to contain the virus fail, thereâs a reasonable chance that it will become endemic. As with influenza, this could mean that deaths occur every year as the pathogen circulates. During the current outbreak, there have been several cases of infected people displaying no symptoms. If such cases are common, it will be more difficult to control the diseaseâs spread, making it more likely that the virus will become endemic.</p><figure class="figure">

The organizationâs director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said his main concern was that the outbreak could spread to countries with fragile health systems.</p><p>Declaring a âpublic health emergency of international concernâ (PHEIC) is the WHOâs highest level of alarm â a step it reserves for events that pose a risk to multiple countries and that require a coordinated international response.</p><p>The WHO considered declaring the coronavirus a global emergency last week, but ultimately decided against the move. At that time, only one country outside China â Vietnam â had confirmed person-to-person transmission of the virus within its borders.</p><p>Now, four other places outside mainland China â Japan, Taiwan, Germany and the United States â have reported person-to-person transmission, as the size and reach of the outbreak have grown. The WHO says that a total of 7,818 cases have been confirmed in 18 countries. Almost 99% of those â 7,736 cases â are in China.</p><p>Tedros praised China for its handling of the outbreak, and recommended against restricting international trade with, and travel to, the country. âThis declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,â he said. âThis is the time for solidarity, not stigma.â</p><p>Alexandra Phelan, a global-health lawyer at Georgetown University in Washington DC, praised Tedrosâs decision and message. âHistorically, a PHEIC is seen as an alert to all countries,â she says. âBut this focus on countries with weak health systems highlights the obligation of wealthier countries with stronger health systems to help them prepare for potential cases.â</p><p><b>30 January 17:45</b> <span class="u-small-caps"><b>gmt</b></span> <b>â Human-to-human transmission confirmed in the United States</b></p><p>The first instance of the coronavirus spreading between people in the United States has been confirmed.

 </div></p><p>Although scientists in China say theyâve been able to grow the virus in the lab, they have not yet shared samples with international researchers â they have shared only the virusâs genetic sequence, says Julian Druce, head of the Virus Identification Laboratory at the Doherty Institute. He says he and his team had heard that labs outside China had struggled to grow the virus, but they found it quite easy. He thinks the success was due to the labâs combined expertise in diagnosing infections as well as isolating and growing viruses in culture. âWeâve got two parts of the puzzle together in one laboratory,â he says.</p><p>Catton says having samples of the virus will enable scientists to create tests that can detect specific immune cells â antibodies â that indicate whether a person has been infected with the new virus. Such tests are especially useful for people with mild or no symptoms. Making a test for antibodies is difficult without samples of the virus, he says. </p><p>A study of a family in Shenzhen, China, identified a child who was infected with the virus but showed no symptoms. The WHO has also reported that three people with the infection outside China have been asymptomatic.</p><p>Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, says the Melbourne groupâs announcement is fantastic news. He says lab-grown samples are essential for research into the behaviour of the virus in culture or in animal hosts. Although virus samples can also be used to validate molecular diagnostic tests, most labs have moved away from using whole viruses in favour of synthetically producing parts of the virus from partial genomes, says Mackay.</p><figure class="figure">

An R<sub>0</sub> higher than 1 means that countermeasures, such as quarantine, will be needed to contain the pathogenâs spread.</p><p>On Thursday evening, after a meeting of an emergency committee responding to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an estimated R<sub>0</sub> of 1.4 to 2.5. Other teams have since come up with <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/" data-track-category="body text link">slightly higher values</a><sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. These estimates are similar to the R<sub>0</sub> of SARS during the early stages of the 2002â03 outbreak, and of the novel strain of H1N1 influenza that caused a pandemic in 2009. But they are higher than R<sub>0</sub> figures estimated during outbreaks of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, a coronavirus similar to SARS. </p><p>

They also point out that R<sub>0</sub> is a moving target that changes over the course of an outbreak â as control measures are implemented â and varies from place to place. In the coming days, health authorities and researchers will be looking for signs that the steps the authorities have taken to stem transmission, such as the travel restrictions in Wuhan and other Chinese cities, have reduced the R<sub>0</sub> there.</p><p>Another important unanswered question surrounding the virusâs spread is whether â and how extensively â people without symptoms can infect others. A study of a cluster of five infections in a family in Shenzhen identified a child who was infected with the virus but did not show any symptoms<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. If such asymptomatic cases are common and these individuals can spread the virus, then containing its spread will be much more difficult, researchers say.

Such studies would also be helpful for identifying ways of stopping spread in households, Bird adds.</p><figure class="figure">

A 30-year-old man in Washington state has been diagnosed with the illness after a trip to China, making the United States the fifth country to report the disease â and the first outside Asia.</p><p>The man had been admitted to a hospital in Washington last week with pneumonia, but âis right now, very healthyâ, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCâs National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta, Georgia, told reporters. He is under observation at the hospital.</p><p>

A hospital in Washington state collected blood from the man and shipped it to the CDC, which identified the virus in the samples on 20 January. The CDC is now tracking down individuals who had contact with the man.</p><p>International airports in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, have been screening arriving passengers for signs of coronavirus infection since 17 January. All three receive direct flights from Wuhan. The CDC says it will now expand the screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago, Illinois. All travellers leaving Wuhan for the United States will be routed to one of the five airports that have screening programmes.</p><p><b>21 January â Researchers must share sequences</b></p><p>In an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00153-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00153-x" data-track-category="body text link">editorial</a>, <i>Nature</i> says that researchers have a crucial role in publishing and sharing genome sequences.
