            Throngs of men and women ventured into the forests of northeastern
            Cambodia in April, lured by a bumper crop of a rare tropical treat
            called samrong. After days of hiking through the wilderness, some of
            the travellers returned to their homes with a bounty of the wrinkled
            seeds, which fetch a high price as a special dessert or an
            ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. But many soon fell ill.
            Khong Chhoem, a 56-year-old rice farmer, says the fevers hit him a
            few days after the expedition. His muscles hurt. His eyes hurt. He
            had unbearable nightmares. A health worker told Chhoem that he had
            tested positive for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the deadliest kind
            of malaria-causing parasite. But because a wave of malaria was
            sweeping through the region, medicine was in short supply. Chhoem
            eventually found a shop that carried the drugs he needed, and he
            recovered. But in the intervening days, mosquitoes probably sucked
            up the parasites in his blood and spread them to other people.
          </p>

          <p>
            After years in decline, malaria infection rates seem to be on the
            rise in northeastern Cambodia, where people are moving deeper into
            lush, mosquito-ridden territories in search of timber and seasonal
            goods such as samrong (<i>Scaphium affine</i>). Their movements
            provide opportunities for <i>P. falciparum</i> — which requires both
            human and insect hosts — to thrive. There are other contributors as
            well, such as treatment delays that allow the parasites to linger
            and spread, and an alarming decline in the potency of gold-standard
            malaria drugs called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).

              Khong Chhoem fell ill with malaria caused by
              <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> this year, after an expedition to
              gather samrong.

          <p>
            What happens next here matters for the entire world; malaria remains
            one of the biggest killers in low-income countries. Estimates of the
            number of deaths each year range from 450,000 to 720,000 — and ACT
            pills keep that toll from being much higher. And although southeast
            Asia accounts for just 7% of malaria cases worldwide, it has a
            notorious history as the breeding ground for strains of malaria
            parasites that resist every drug thrown at them and then spread to
            other regions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2015, reports of drug resistance prompted the governments of five
            countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion — Cambodia, Thailand,
            Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar — to pledge to banish
            <i>P. falciparum</i> from the region by 2025. Together with the
            World Health Organization (WHO), the countries drew up plans and
            budgets. This year, the nations’ governments have committed US$41
            million towards the effort; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
            Tuberculosis and Malaria also backed elimination efforts in the
            region, with a 3-year, $243-million grant. Donors such as the Bill
            &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Asian Development Bank will
            add more than $20 million to the fight this year.
          </p>

              Near Cambodia’s border with Laos, people often travel into the
              forests on small tractors to harvest timber and other goods.

          <p>
            But the rise of cases in northeastern Cambodia shows how difficult
            getting to zero will be — and how crucial. As long as
            <i>P. falciparum</i> exists, it can resurge. And the last parasites
            remaining are the hardest to find. They reside in the hinterlands,
            borderlands and war zones — and in people who show no signs of the
            disease. “Malaria is very clever — it hides out where you don’t know
            and comes back when you aren’t ready,” says Ladda Kajeechiwa, a
            malaria-programme manager at a branch of the Mahidol Oxford Tropical
            Medicine Research Unit (MORU) in Mae Sot, Thailand.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “Malaria is very clever — it hides out where you don’t know and
            comes back when you aren’t ready.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            To eliminate malaria, public-health officials are trying to cover
            the region with volunteers and health workers who can dispense
            malaria drugs promptly, and report any signs of an upsurge. They are
            also looking to researchers for tools that can forestall drug
            resistance, technologies that improve detection of the parasite, and
            evidence on strategies for rooting it out. The pressure is on.
            “Everybody has fears of malaria resurgence,” says Myaing Nyunt, a
            malaria researcher at Duke Global Health Institute in Durham, North
            Carolina. She worries that donors will tire of the cause, and that
            the people in the Greater Mekong region will grow to resent the
            obsession with malaria when they have more pressing needs. Yet if
            the effort lets up, malaria will roar back.

            “That is why it is so important to eliminate it as quickly as
            possible,” Myaing Nyunt says.

                southeast Asia has given rise to several drug-resistant strains

            Drug resistance has a way of growing from a nuisance to a serious
            problem. Although an incompletely cleared infection might not kill a
            person, the parasites that survive can go on to infect others and
            their lineage grows stronger. To stay a step ahead of resistance,
            researchers at MORU renovated a dilapidated clinic in Siem Pang in
            northeastern Cambodia earlier this year. They are expanding a trial
            to test a combination of artemisinin with two partner drugs, rather
            than one. That combination should kill parasites that haven’t yet
            made it to the triple-resistant stage. But trial leader Arjen
            Dondorp, deputy director of MORU in Bangkok, says that the only
            certain way to halt resistance is to rid the Mekong region of
            malaria altogether. At the moment, the WHO considers elimination
            feasible because there are relatively few infections in southeast
            Asia. But the opportunity to do so won’t last long: as ACTs start
            failing, case numbers will rise. “This is the scenario we predicted
            and now we see it unfolding in Cambodia,” Dondorp says.
          </p>

          <p>
            To hasten the elimination of <i>P. falciparum</i> in the region,
            public-health officials in the five countries have promised to
            strengthen the basic mechanisms of malaria control, which include
            maintaining a steady force of health workers. But gaps remain in
            this system, particularly in Cambodia and Myanmar, which are among
            the poorest countries in Asia. To help them, Benjamin Rolfe, head of
            the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance in Singapore, has been
            garnering funds and political support throughout Asia. “We are so
            close to the end game that it is not good business sense to let drug
            resistance happen,” Rolfe says. “If we do, all the investments we’ve
            made so far here and in Africa will amount to an incredible waste of
            money.”

          <p class="first-para">
            Recent findings suggest that the task of elimination will be even
            harder than expected. Health workers typically diagnose malaria
            using a simple rapid diagnostic test (RDT): a pin-prick of blood is
            added to a test strip, which quickly turns red if it detects
            proteins from <i>P. falciparum</i>. The tests adequately distinguish
            malarial fevers from other infections. But Mallika Imwong, a
            molecular biologist at Mahidol University in Bangkok, wondered
            whether some people might carry too few parasites to make them ill —
            or to show up on a RDT. To find out, she fished for parasite DNA in
            vials of blood shipped from Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam, using a
            sensitive method called real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
            In 2015, she reported<sup><a href="#ref-CR7">7</a></sup> that only
            one-quarter of <i>Plasmodium</i> infections were detected by the
            usual RDT on average. The disparity was at times remarkable. “I was
            really surprised,” says Imwong. “In one village, only 4% or 5% of
            the people were positive with RDTs, but 68% were infected.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Researchers have not yet discovered how or why the parasites can
            persist at low levels in a person’s bloodstream. Whatever the
            reason, there are signs<sup><a href="#ref-CR8">8</a></sup> that
            these covert microbes multiply when conditions are right — such as
            when the rainy season starts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Knowing that silent infections exist is one thing, but actually
            finding them is quite another. Health officials say it is
            unrealistic to conduct PCR analyses on vials of blood collected
            across the Greater Mekong Subregion. Rather, health workers need
            something like a rapid diagnostic test that requires no
            refrigeration, lab equipment or special training, but that can
            detect parasites even when they are not abundant.

            In central Myanmar, a roving team of doctors, researchers and
            technicians are piloting one such technology. Thura Htay, a young
            physician and public-health researcher swerves on his motorcycle
            over rugged red-dirt roads with a green plastic supply bag gripped
            between his thighs. He is pensive, overseeing his group on its
            mission to collect pin-pricks of blood from 357 people in 3 remote
            villages by the end of the day. In these mountains, the things most
            likely to thwart the mission are flash floods and signs of wild
            elephants. (When startled by the sound of motorbikes, the animals
            sometimes attack people, homes and farms.)

            Today, the path remains clear and the team arrives at the Shwe Kyin
            village before noon. A few dozen people linger on a concrete
            platform, where tables, chairs and bowls of pickled tea leaves,
            fried nuts and sweets have been neatly arranged in anticipation of
            the team’s visit. Although no one from the village has been
            diagnosed with malaria this year, Thura Htay says, “I want to know
            if asymptomatic malaria is here”.
          </p>

          <p>
            A teacher in a rhinestone-studded top holds out her finger to a team
            member. He pricks it and places a drop of blood onto a conventional
            diagnostic test, and then onto an experimental version that the team
            is assessing to see whether it is more sensitive. Then he pricks
            another finger and presses it against two kinds of filter paper —
            one intended to capture DNA, and the other, proteins. The team
            swiftly hangs the papers on a clothes line to dry.
          </p>

          <p>
            The teacher, Khin Zar Lwin, says she’s happy to help scientists
            learn about her village, but the emphasis on malaria by this and
            other groups feels like overkill; few people here get the disease,
            and there are other pressing health concerns. Pregnant women and
            elderly people who need urgent care, for example, must travel for
            hours on foot and then by boat down a tumultuous river to reach the
            nearest hospital, in the town of Singu.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the late afternoon, the team packages the tests and blood spots
            into coolers strapped to the back of motorcycles, and returns to a
            concrete building in Singu. Team members hang the papers in a pair
            of cupboards, cooled and screened off to protect against mould and
            flies. Thura Htay sleeps on a bed beside them to ensure they are
            safe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every few weeks, the team ships samples to a renovated lab at the
            government’s Department of Medical Research in Yangon. There,
            researchers compare the results of the two rapid diagnostic tests
            with results from a PCR analysis on blood spots collected on one of
            the filter papers.

            By the end of this year, Thura Htay — and his boss, Myaing Nyunt —
            will know whether the new diagnostic tests can be used to map out
            the regions where symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria occur. Such
            ‘hotspot’ maps will help officials to decide on elimination
            strategies for different regions. But the question remains of how to
            handle communities with hidden parasites. One possible answer comes
            from eastern Myanmar.

          <p>
            A few years ago, researchers mapped the malaria hotspots in Karen, a
            state along Myanmar’s border with Thailand that has resisted
            government rule since the country gained independence from Britain
            seven decades ago. (A symbol of that is its rejection of the state’s
            official name, Kayin.) Conflict has made many residents mistrustful
            of outsiders. But when MORU’s Ladda Kajeechiwa visited one of the
            hotspots in May this year, an old man in the village of Ta Oo Hta
            greeted her warmly.

            The man, Bo Lay, recalls the toll that malaria took during the
            community’s darkest days. Burmese troops and armed groups attacked
            Ta Oo Hta several times, he says, and burnt it to ashes at least
            once. Each bout of violence drove people into the mountains, where
            they slept among the snakes and leeches. Those who became severely
            ill with malaria trekked through the jungle and crossed the Moei
            River to refugee clinics along the Thai border in Mae Sot.
            “Sometimes they died along the way,” he says.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bo Lay was glad when he heard about MORU’s plan to wipe out malaria,
            and he discussed it with his neighbours, easing their suspicions of
            outsiders asking to draw blood and deliver drugs. This plan
            consisted of controlling malaria — and then pressing the accelerator
            on elimination. Beginning in 2014, MORU and other local
            organizations strengthened a network of 1,222 village malaria
            workers by training and paying them to treat and report any malaria
            cases that they find. In addition, they analysed blood samples
            across the state with PCR to find pockets of malaria. They then
            asked every healthy person in a hotspot — about 4% of Karen’s
            population — to swallow ACTs once a month for three months<sup
              ><a href="#ref-CR9">9</a></sup
            >. In surveys after the intervention, the researchers found that the
            incidence of malaria in the state had dropped by 90%. The only
            stronghold of the disease is in a rugged region in the north, where
            armed separatist groups rarely accept outside interventions.
          </p>

          <p>
            “We have strong evidence that elimination can happen,” says François
            Nosten, a French researcher who founded MORU’s facility in Mae Sot,
            the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, in 1986. But to his frustration,
            governments in the region have put mass-drug-administration
            strategies on hold for a number of reasons.

            For instance, it takes a great deal of work to convince people who
            don’t feel ill to take medicines that can cause fatigue and nausea,
            and it requires funds to pay and organize health workers to survey
            populations for the parasite and distribute drugs. If a significant
            number of people don’t take the full course of therapy, parasite
            reservoirs remain — and some researchers fear that this situation
            could foster drug resistance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Karen’s nearly disease-free status remains tenuous as long as
            malaria exists in the broader region. And its defence against
            imported cases relies on continued international aid because there
            is no stable health system in Karen. At the moment, the Wellcome
            Trust, the Global Fund and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation
            provide funds for malaria workers that ensure that any cases that
            pop up in the state are treated before the parasites have a chance
            to spread. But if donors put their funds elsewhere — or fighting
            breaks out again in Karen, as it has in the past — the system will
            fall apart and malaria will resurge. “The NGOs [non-governmental
            organizations] could pull out, the political situation is unstable,”
            Kajeechiwa says. “We work day by day, year by year, without
            guarantees on what happens tomorrow.”
          </p>

            A similar fragility exists in other states along Myanmar’s border,
            such as Kachin in the north and Rakhine in the west, the site of the
            ongoing Rohingya crisis. Since August 2017, more than half a million
            members of the Muslim Rohingya ethnic group have fled killings,
            arson and rape at the hands of Myanmar’s troops and nationalistic
            Buddhists. In these areas of the country, aid organizations and
            private clinics handle malaria because the public-health system is
            fractured. That concern resonates with Saw Nay Htoo, programme
            director of the Burma Medical Association, a non-profit organization
            working with minority ethnic groups. In an office in Mae Sot where
            vines penetrate the panelled ceiling, he says: “We want to eliminate
            malaria, but first we need peace.”

            Myaing Nyunt believes the common enemy of malaria could help to
            unite warring factions. She manifests that hope. A political
            dissident who fled from Myanmar’s military government in 1988,
            Myaing Nyunt now works with government researchers there. Squeezed
            into the back seat of a jeep beside Zaw Lin, an official in
            Myanmar’s Vector-Borne Disease Control department in Nay Pyi Taw,
            she explains why she decided to partner with researchers who are
            part of a government that has been accused of human-rights
            violations. Because there is no quick fix for malaria — no powerful
            vaccine — the fight against the disease requires a sustainable
            health system. As a scientist, she says she can develop top-notch
            malaria-elimination approaches and tools, but those won’t matter if
            governments do not put them into practice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Always frank, Nyunt says that the decision to work closely with the
            government has made her research slow and hard. There are
            bureaucratic meetings to attend, labs to be built from scratch and
            students who are in need of long-term mentorship and stipends. “We
            are talking about a health system that has been underfunded and
            underdeveloped since the 1960s, and that’s not going to change
            overnight,” she says. “But you have to do it this way because
            changes must come from within.”
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “We want to eliminate malaria, but first we need peace.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            If the new diagnostic that she and Thura Htay are road-testing in
            central Myanmar works, Zaw Lin will help the government to decide
            whether to pre-emptively distribute ACTs in hotspots, as was done in
            Karen, or to routinely screen people in those places with the new
            test, and treat those who test positive. He doesn’t shy away from
            talking about the country’s conflicts. In addition to political
            instability, he and other public-health officials find themselves
            pushing to sustain enthusiasm for their mission amid other health
            concerns. But he has seen at first hand how malaria bounces back if
            it’s not obliterated. It resurged in Myanmar in the 1990s, just as
            it seems to be doing in Cambodia and several other countries now.

          <p>
            Losing inertia in the Mekong region, the motherland of drug
            resistance, could be a disaster. “This is the last-mile challenge in
            front of us,” Zaw Lin says. “If we don’t eliminate malaria, deaths
            can shoot up like a hidden bomb.”
