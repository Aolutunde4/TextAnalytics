              Peace efforts in the country have ended 50 years of intense
              conflict. Now, scientists are studying former fighters and victims
              as they attempt to heal.

            When she first began studying the people who had terrorized her
            country, Natalia Trujillo prepared herself to come face to face with
            monsters.
          </p>

          <p>
            She would be interviewing former combatants from the long, bloody
            conflict that had gripped Colombia for more than 50 years. The
            complex power struggle between guerrilla insurgents, the government,
            paramilitary groups and drug traffickers had killed hundreds of
            thousands of people and displaced millions. Four of Trujillo’s
            family members had been kidnapped, and the violence had driven her
            father from his farmland. Some of her colleagues had experienced
            much worse.

              Neuroscientist Natalia Trujillo has never known Colombia without
              conflict.

          <p>
            Trujillo, now a neuroscientist at the University of Antioquia in
            Medellín, was interested in studying the psychological roots of
            violence by looking at fighters who had laid down their weapons and
            were trying to re-enter civilian society. Her chance came in 2010,
            with a government reintegration programme that had gathered hundreds
            of ex-combatants for the day in Medellín’s botanical garden.
          </p>

          <p>
            She and her research team entered the enclave with a battery of
            cognitive tests, panic buttons — in case something went wrong — and
            some preconceived ideas. “I thought people who can kill their
            neighbours, that can destroy their communities, that can have the
            heart to force other people to abandon their farms — they have to be
            really bad,” Trujillo says. She found a few who met her
            expectations. With chains around their necks and boastful swaggers,
            some tried to intimidate the researchers. But more often, the
            scientists found ordinary people, strolling in the garden and eating
            ice cream with their children.
          </p>

          <p>
            “At the beginning I was pretty disappointed,” she says. If something
            were wrong with their brains, it would provide an easy explanation
            for the evil they had done. But after studying more than 600
            combatants, she has begun to grasp the complexity of their
            experiences. “I realized not all of them are sociopaths. I realized
            most of them are also victims.”
          </p>

          <p>
            That recognition has led Trujillo and her colleagues to re-examine
            not only their own feelings about ex-combatants, but also the
            country’s approach to dealing with them. Colombia’s government is
            currently engaged in one of the largest peace efforts in history. As
            part of a 2016 treaty with the left-wing guerrilla group known as
            the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the government
            will grant amnesty to fighters who leave the conflict and complete a
            re-incorporation programme, provided they have not committed serious
            crimes. Around 6,800 FARC fighters have entered already.

            The effort, which is politically controversial and expected to cost
            129.5 trillion Colombian pesos (US$46 billion), faces overwhelming
            odds. But it grants scientists a unique opportunity to understand a
            population that has both inflicted and suffered the horrors of war.
            Most research into the psychological roots of violence and trauma
            has been performed with veterans from wealthy countries who fought
            in conflicts far from home. Most of Colombia’s ex-combatants, by
            contrast, have little education and are trying to re-enter the same
            society they once terrorized. There, they face enormous stigma and
            resentment, which makes it difficult for them to find work and form
            relationships with others.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “I realized not all of them are sociopaths. I realized most of them
            are also victims.”
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            A handful of scientists are now studying the former fighters in
            unprecedented detail, in the hope that they will be able to inform
            and guide the peacemaking process. They have found that years of
            isolation and exposure to violence might have altered the
            ex-combatants’ psychology and cognitive processing in subtle ways.
            In laboratory tests, many have difficulty empathizing with others
            and make flawed ethical judgements — shortcomings that could affect
            how they engage in civilian life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Scientists are now setting up long-term studies in towns that were
            plagued by conflict, to track how cognition and attitudes might
            change over the course of the reconciliation process, both for
            ex-combatants and for civilians. The data could eventually inform
            other war-torn countries’ recovery efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the research is also revealing just how deep the challenge is.
            And some experts worry that the care available to ex-combatants in
            the meantime is inadequate. “It’s going to be incredibly difficult
            to get out of this vicious cycle,” says Jiovani Arias, a
            psychotherapist and political scientist at the University of the
            Andes in Bogotá. Without investment in improving mental health, he
            says, the legacy of violence that affects ex-combatants and
            civilians alike could torpedo Colombia’s precarious peace efforts.

                Colombia’s armed conflict took root in the 1960s and waxed and
                waned as various militant groups vied for control of Colombian
                territory. Terrorist attacks tallied by the Global Terrorism
                Database reflect only some of the 260,000 estimated deaths
                attributed to the conflict. About 7 million people were
                displaced by the fighting and thousands were kidnapped.

                By the mid-2000s, several paramilitary groups had entered into a
                peace deal with the government. Still, the fighting wore on with
                FARC until a ceasefire in June 2016. The final pact was signed
                in November of that year.

                Under the agreement, thousands of former FARC combatants are
                entering designated ‘transit zones’ throughout the country —
                known officially as territorial spaces for training and
                reincorporation (ETCRs). Here, they will prepare to re-enter
                Colombian society. But several guerrilla groups continue to
                fight, including 1,000 FARC ‘dissidents’ who have refused to
                sign on to the accord.

            As a bus full of scientists pulls into the town of Vista Hermosa in
            central Colombia, Diana Matallana, a neuropsychologist at the
            Pontifical Xavierian University in Bogotá, still seems unable to
            believe where she is. “Five years ago, you could not come here,” she
            says. “It’s like a symbol of the hardest part of the conflict.”

          <p>
            The Meta region, where Vista Hermosa lies, was one of the areas
            abandoned by the Colombian military in the 1990s and left to be
            governed alternately by paramilitary groups and guerrillas. It was a
            fraught arrangement. The guerrillas helped to develop infrastructure
            but were swift to kill suspected informants. The paramilitaries
            tended to be more ruthless, torturing suspected spies and leaving
            bodies across the doorsteps of elementary schools. Both sides dealt
            heavily in the cocaine trade and kidnapped thousands of people for
            ransom — including Matallana’s brother.
          </p>

          <p>
            The disarmament and rehabilitation campaign is run by Colombia’s
            Reincorporation and Normalization Agency (ARN) in Bogotá. The ARN
            had been established years earlier, and it has since facilitated the
            reintegration of some 20,000 paramilitaries and guerrillas who left
            the conflict independently or as part of a separate peace agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            The 26 transit zones that former fighters are entering offer
            amenities such as education and health care, and help to provide at
            least a measure of protection for the ex-combatants, who are
            regularly targeted by former enemies, FARC dissidents and civilians.
            After completing a programme, ex-combatants can receive ID cards
            that allow them to live and work legally in the country. The
            prospect of their return doesn’t thrill some local residents of
            Vista Hermosa. A road sign in Spanish that reads “Together, peace
            and life after the conflict are possible” has been pelted with pink
            paintballs. “Someone disagrees,” remarks one of the researchers.

          <p>
            Matallana and Carlos Gómez, a psychiatrist at Xavierian, are
            planning to launch a 10- to 20-year study following more than 2,000
            people in Vista Hermosa, civilians and ex-combatants alike. “We are
            planning for the first time — in Colombia and the world — to learn
            what things help for reconciliation,” Gómez says.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team intends to measure factors such as neuro-development in
            children, social cognition and emotional regulation in adults, and
            all participants’ mental health to aid the reintegration process. In
            a pilot project funded by philanthropic foundations, they have
            surveyed 200 civilians, plus representatives for 150 ex-combatants
            living in a transit zone just 3 hours away. “We need to have good
            data to see how it works, and how we could make interventions
            rapidly if we see the process is not coming well,” Gómez says.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s been hard for researchers here and elsewhere to study whether
            such programmes can prevent combatants from returning to crime,
            largely because it is often impossible to track the outcomes of
            people who go through them. “We just assume it has an effect, and we
            have no other choice,” says Enzo Nussio, a political scientist at
            the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet Nussio and others are hopeful about Colombia’s prospects. It has
            many more resources to devote to the effort than countries, such as
            Burundi and Sudan, which have taken on similar efforts with little
            success.
          </p>

          <p>
            The former combatants, meanwhile, face a mix of challenges — some
            familiar and some new. Like veterans from other conflicts, many find
            it difficult to be around people who do not understand the
            experience of combat, says Thomas Elbert, a psychologist at the
            University of Konstanz in Germany. They may reach out to others who
            have lived in violence, which can be dangerous in a place such as
            Colombia, where drug traffickers and other armed groups still
            operate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Colombia itself poses some unique challenges, Gómez says. Unlike
            those fighting civil wars in many other places, Colombia’s guerrilla
            fighters are not driven by race or religion, but by political
            ideology. Reprogramming their hearts and minds might call for
            strategies different from those used for other radicalized
            militants, war criminals or serial killers, and no one knows what
            those strategies should be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gustavo Tovar, president of Vista Hermosa’s municipal council, fears
            that his town — and the country — isn’t ready for the wave of
            ex-combatants. “Colombia is in the middle of this metamorphosis,” he
            says. “We went into it without knowing what we are doing.”

                West of Meta lies Valle del Cauca, a mostly flat agricultural
                region surrounded by mountains. Here, in a luxurious hotel
                overlooking vineyards and sugarcane fields, former FARC
                commander Juan Carlos Sánchez is watching videos on a laptop.
                Designed for research, they feature different types of
                altercation: an argument between two people, someone getting
                bumped by a chair, one person stabbing another in the back with
                a knife.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sánchez joined the guerrillas in 1998 while living in Meta. It
                was not entirely by choice, he says. When the Colombian military
                abandoned the region, the FARC became the de facto government.
                The guerrillas persuaded locals to arm themselves in case the
                paramilitaries and government returned, telling them that this
                was the only way to protect their families. Eventually, Sánchez
                joined the group officially.
              </p>

              <p>
                At first, he says, the guerrillas did not attack civilians —
                they just schooled their recruits in politics and warfare
                skills. But over time, the FARC became more violent and
                suspicious of others. “From the day I entered the organization
                to the day I deserted, I always had questions,” he says — about
                himself, his comrades and the people giving orders,
                particularly, their willingness to kill former allies. But
                Sánchez kept quiet because questioning orders would get him
                killed. Instead, he rose in the ranks, eventually leading some
                25 fighters.
              </p>

              <p>
                By 2005, he had become more disillusioned with the FARC. A list
                of suspected informants he had been ordered to kill included 12-
                and 13-year-old children, as well as 2 people whom he knew from
                his childhood. He ordered his troops to do it — something that
                haunts him to this day. “It is you that carries the weight,” he
                says.

                  execute myself.”

              </figure>

              <p>
                Then, a few years later, the guerrillas convicted his girlfriend
                — also a FARC member — of espionage. Sánchez made plans to run
                away with her, but was discovered and had to flee on his own. He
                later learnt that she had been executed.
              </p>

              <p>
                For three years, Sánchez lived in hiding in Meta, seeing enemies
                everywhere. “I lived in constant worry,” he says. Eventually, a
                friend told him about the government rehabilitation programme,
                and he joined. He moved to Valle del Cauca and now clears fields
                for a living. He has seen a psychologist, and has begun reading
                the Bible. “Between the two, I’ve found a way to forgive myself
                and to forgive others,” he says.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the hotel, Sánchez watches the videos of altercations
                interspersed with a series of questions, probing whether the
                imagery bothers him, or whether a responsible party should be
                punished. Then he tries to identify the emotions on a series of
                faces.
              </p>

              <p>
                “We’re looking at what kind of mistakes they make,” says Agustín
                Ibáñez, a neuroscientist at Favaloro University in Buenos Aires,
                Argentina, who is administering the test, a mock run of the type
                he has given to around 350 Colombian ex-combatants. Ibáñez aims
                to discern how isolation from society and exposure to violence
                might have impaired their emotional processing and moral
                judgement. Ex-combatants — FARC and paramilitary alike — tend to
                have trouble distinguishing between emotions, especially fear
                and anger. Although it is unclear whether these effects persist
                outside the lab, Ibáñez and his team worry that emotional
                problems could make life even harder for the former fighters, as
                they have for ex-combatants elsewhere.

                He and Eduar Herrera, a cognitive psychologist at Icesi
                University in Cali, began this line of research in 2014, working
                with a group of paramilitaries in jail for war crimes. They had
                killed an average of 33 people each, and some were responsible
                for massacring hundreds.

              <p>
                “The first time, we were very scared,” Ibáñez recalls. The
                ex-combatants weren’t handcuffed, and met the researchers face
                to face. “You have the feeling they can kill everyone if they
                want.”
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2017, the researchers found that a key characteristic of
                ex-combatants is how they judge the morality of an action<sup
                  ><a href="#ref-CR1">1</a></sup
                >. Most participants would condemn an attempted poisoning, for
                instance, even if it failed to kill the target. But Ibáñez’s
                group has found that ex-combatants are less likely to condemn
                someone for a failed murder attempt, reasoning that if the
                victim didn’t die, there was no harm done. At the same time,
                they are more likely to want to punish people for harm that is
                clearly accidental. By their logic, the outcome is more
                important than the intention.
              </p>

              <p>
                Trujillo has also found striking differences in her
                participants. In a study of 624 ex-guerrillas and
                ex-paramilitaries<sup><a href="#ref-CR2">2</a></sup
                >, she and her colleagues found that the ability to empathize
                fell into 3 clusters: 22% of ex-combatants functioned much like
                people who haven’t experienced violence; 32% had the ability to
                recognize pain or misfortune in others but weren’t as affected
                by it; and the rest could neither recognize feelings such as
                emotional distress in others, nor empathize with them.
              </p>

              <p>
                The researchers wonder whether these ex-combatants — who
                demobilized voluntarily — are similar to the 6,800 FARC fighters
                who entered the reincorporation programme as part of the 2016
                treaty, many on orders from their commanders. Unlike Sánchez,
                many are still steadfastly ideological. Oscar Vega, for example,
                a slight, intense former FARC commander who lives in the transit
                zone near Vista Hermosa, steers almost every conversation around
                to ways in which Colombia’s government and educational system
                hurt people. He still lives for the cause. “Our documents and
                our ideology say that we have to take control of power either
                through arms or through a political way,” he says.

                Trujillo is comparing various types of therapy to determine how
                best to help the ex-combatants improve their performance in
                tests of empathy<sup><a href="#ref-CR3">3</a></sup
                >. And she and her colleagues are using electroencephalography
                (EEG) to monitor ex-combatants’ brain activity, hoping to learn
                how they process information<sup><a href="#ref-CR4">4</a></sup
                >. In unpublished research, the team has found that former
                fighters are quicker to recognize faces than are civilians —
                even though they are slower to identify the emotions on them.
                They are also better at performing memory tasks that are
                accompanied by violent imagery such as blood or corpses. People
                whom the researchers identified as victims of violence show the
                opposite pattern — such imagery disturbs their concentration and
                slows their responses. The researchers think that the
                ex-combatants’ neurocircuitry has adapted to react faster to
                threats.
              </p>

              <p>
                Trujillo’s group advises the Medellín branch of the ARN in its
                effort to rehabilitate ex-combatants. But trying to use science
                to inform policy can feel like sculpting with dry sand.
                “Research has been very complicated because it’s a very new
                topic, not just for Colombia but for cognitive and social
                neuroscience literature,” she says.
              </p>

              <p>
                Researchers also worry that the government could lose patience.
                “If you cannot find something strong to demonstrate what’s going
                on, you cannot propose a solution,” says José David López, an
                engineer who works with Trujillo interpreting EEG data at the
                University of Antioquia. “They need it now, not in ten years.”

            Viviana Misas’s wrist bears the name of the baby she miscarried
            while living with the National Liberation Army (ELN) — another
            left-wing guerrilla group that is still active in Colombia. Misas
            joined the ELN at 15 years old to get away from her family, and grew
            to love the ideology and the companionship it provided. But then she
            fell down during a difficult march and was injured, losing her
            pregnancy. Her companions abandoned her, and she ended up in the
            hospital for a long time. Distrusting her loyalty after that, a
            fellow combatant — her closest friend — betrayed Misas to the
            Colombian army. She was captured and agreed to demobilize.

            Like Sánchez, she can’t return to her home in Medellín, for fear
            that the ELN would kill her as a traitor. Although Misas enjoys her
            work as a tour guide in Valle del Cauca, depression keeps her from
            pursuing her dreams. “I wish that when I get sad, I would be like a
            normal person that just gets sad for a little moment and doesn’t
            have thoughts as strange as mine,” she says. She hasn’t seen any
            psychotherapists, but her dog provides some solace, as does
            religion. Still, her thoughts turn dark — perhaps, she says, the
            real reason she joined the group was because she hoped to be killed.
            “How can I let go of those thoughts?” she asks.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the ARN’s data, more than 90% of ex-combatants in the
            programme have a psychosocial problem, such as post-traumatic stress
            disorder or anxiety. Regional ARN coordinator Juan Fernando Vélez
            says that mental health is one of his top priorities in working with
            them. Trujillo’s data, he says, persuaded his office to create a
            special reintegration track for people with psychiatric problems.
            “We cannot give to society an individual that is not adjusted,” he
            says.
          </p>

          <p>
            Joshua Mitrotti, who directed the ARN for three years before
            resigning in March, says that the agency’s programmes are based on
            efforts in Central America in the 1990s, which provided vocational
            training and education for armed groups. Psychosocial support is an
            integral component, he says.

          </figure>

          <p>
            The ARN’s programme for guerrillas and paramilitaries who
            demobilized voluntarily included 30 months’ worth of psychosocial
            services, from about 300 psychologists and 65 social workers, on
            average. So far, 20,490 people have completed the reintegration
            process, and the ARN says that more than 70% have successfully
            re-entered society.
          </p>

          <p>
            But with tens of thousands of ex-combatants in Colombia, there are
            simply not enough skilled mental-health practitioners to provide
            basic care, much less intensive cognitive therapy. As a result, some
            worry that the reintegration programme might be providing poor
            treatment. “It’s not that they are doing things wrong, but they are
            incomplete,” Herrera says.
          </p>

          <p>
            One challenge is the difficulty of providing treatment to adults who
            might not have completed elementary school and cannot read, a skill
            required for some common therapies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mitrotti says that the ARN has been adjusting the approaches to make
            them more appropriate. According to the ARN, 30% of the people
            coming for psychosocial services last year did so without any
            monetary inducement (ex-combatants often receive a stipend for
            participating in programmes). “They are coming not because they’re
            paid but because they believe they need the support of our
            professionals,” Mitrotti says.
          </p>

          <p>
            But help for the newly demobilized FARC members has been slow in
            coming. Andres Restrepo, a sociologist who works in a transit zone
            in Caqueta, says that the FARC ex-combatants there are not receiving
            any mental-health care at all. Restrepo says the ARN has promised
            that 6 psychologists will come to the region, but that even that
            wouldn’t be sufficient for the 1,000 ex-combatants and their
            families living there, now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Restrepo fears that if these individuals are not psychologically
            stable, the rejection from society — including their own families —
            could drive them back into violence. “Nobody helped them imagine a
            life without weapons,” he says.

            In Piñalito, a tiny, dusty town of fluorescent wooden houses on the
            outskirts of Vista Hermosa, civilians are still getting accustomed
            to peace. “It’s great — there are no dead people,” says Carlos
            Garcia, an elderly retired shopkeeper. He remembers hearing regular
            gunfire right outside his door as the FARC fought the
            paramilitaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now the streets are quiet and people linger at outside cafes. A few
            are missing legs; Colombia has one of the highest rates of landmine
            casualties in the world, and Meta is one of the most heavily mined
            regions. Against the backdrop of a government crackdown on the
            cocaine trade, falling oil prices and rising fears that peace is
            temporary, the people of Piñalito seem to have few prospects for the
            future.
          </p>

          <blockquote>

          </blockquote>

          <p>
            And the peace agreement itself is threatened. This month, Colombia
            will hold its presidential election, and the key issue is whether to
            renegotiate the deal to make it less favourable for the FARC. Many
            of the guerrillas, meanwhile, are losing faith in the process. Some
            of the transit zones where FARC members were required to live for a
            time still have no running water or sanitation. And farming and
            vocational-development programmes have been slow to take off. Across
            the country, more than half of the guerrillas have left the zones,
            opting to take their chances in a society that is unsafe for them.
            Since the agreement, hundreds of former FARC members have been
            killed.

            As ex-combatants re-enter society or retreat into the jungle,
            experts worry about the stigma they carry — of being affiliated with
            the FARC and of mental illness. Matallana hopes that one of the
            things her research can do is to show the public how trauma affects
            ex-combatants and civilians alike.
          </p>

          <p>
            Resources are in short supply and the problem is unimaginably
            complex, says Vélez. Ultimately, he says, Colombia’s success rests
            on the will of its people and their ability to make peace with the
            past. “There are no magical formulas,” he says. “The only thing we
            need to understand is that everybody needs — deserves — a second
            chance.”
